In the film, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) pulls Deadpool from his quiet life and sets him on a mission with Wolverine that will change the history of the MCU.\\n\\nDevelopment on a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film began at [[20th Century Fox]] by November 2016, but was placed on hold after the studio was [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquired by Disney]] in March 2019. Control of the character was transferred to Marvel Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds. It integrates Deadpool with the MCU and retains the [[R-rating (Motion Picture Association)|R rating]] of the previous films, making it the first MCU film to have such a rating. [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] joined in November 2020 as writers. Reese and Wernick returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022, when Levy was hired as director. They, along with Reynolds and Wells, had difficulty figuring out the film\\'s story until Jackman decided to reprise his role as Wolverine from Fox\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] in August 2022. Filming began in May 2023 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, with additional filming in [[Norfolk]] and at Bovingdon Film Studios. Production was suspended in July due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]], but resumed in November and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in January 2024. The film\\'s title was revealed a month later.\\n\\n\\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' premiered on July 22, 2024, at the [[David H. Koch Theater]] in New York City, and is scheduled to be released in the United States on July 26, 2024, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Five|Phase Five]] of the MCU.\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nOn [[Earth-10005]],{{efn|The film gives the name \"Earth-10005\" to the main reality of [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />}} [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson]] has retired from being the masked vigilante known as Deadpool after being rejected from joining the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] in [[Earth-616 (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Earth-616]], the \"[[Sacred Timeline]]\" in 2018, and breaking up with his girlfriend [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]]. During his birthday party, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) captures Wilson and delivers him to [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]], who offers him to join Earth-616. However, Paradox also reveals that Wilson\\'s timeline would deteriorate as a result of the death of [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett]],{{Efn|name=Logan|As depicted in \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017)}} who is revealed to be the timeline\\'s \"anchor being\". Wilson steals Paradox\\'s [[TemPad]] to travel the multiverse and find a variant of Logan to save his timeline.\\n\\nAfter encountering various Logan variants, Wilson takes one back to the TVA, where he learns that this particular Logan destroyed his own universe before Paradox prunes them both into the [[Void (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Void]]. Wilson and Logan fight before they and [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]{{Efn|name=JohnnyStorm|from \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\\'\\' (2005)}} are captured and sent to [[Cassandra Nova]], who Logan knows as the twin sister of [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]]. Upon arriving at Nova\\'s lair, she kills Storm and tries to puzzle Wilson with the feeling of not being needed, before [[Alioth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alioth]] appears. Wilson and Logan escape before Alioth can consume them.\\n\\nFollowing their escape, Wilson and Logan are directed by a variant of Wilson to travel to the borderlands to join the resistance against Nova and her forces, but Logan chastises Wilson for hiding the fact that Wilson knew how to return them to their original timelines. Wilson teams up with the \"Others\", including [[Elektra (character)|Elektra]],{{Efn|name=Elektra|from \\'\\'[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]\\'\\' (2005)}} [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]],{{Efn|name=Blade|from \\'\\'[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]\\'\\' (1998)}} [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]],{{Efn|name=Gambit|from the aborted \\'\\'Gambit\\'\\' film, planned as a spin-off to \\'\\'[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]\\'\\' (2009)}} and [[X-23]], to confront Nova. Logan initially refuses to cooperate, but eventually relents after a conversation with X-23 about the tragic past making him the worst Wolverine in the multiverse.\\n\\nLogan joins the others and confront Nova with Wilson. Nova has Logan mentally incapacitated, but Wilson places [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]]\\'s helmet on her to block her powers. [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] shoots Nova and reveals himself as Paradox\\'s sleeper agent assigned to keep her inside the Void. Logan persuades Wilson to remove the helmet to allow Nova to heal, and guarantees that Xavier would help her if he knows she still exists. In exchange, Nova uses a sling ring from a [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Doctor Strange]] variant to open a portal for the duo to travel to Wade\\'s timeline.\\n\\nUpon arriving on Earth-10005, Wilson and Logan find that Paradox is using the Time Ripper, a device Paradox developed to destroy Wilson\\'s timeline without permission from his superior. Nova quickly learns this from the executed Pyro as well, as she arrives through another portal and kidnaps Paradox. Wilson and Logan battle the Deadpool Corps, an army of Deadpool variants coming from the portal, before Nova takes control of the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines as revenge for Paradox\\'s betrayal. Paradox tells Wilson and Logan that one can disrupt the power flow of the Time Ripper at the cost of their life. Using their own bodies as a conductor, Wilson and Logan destroy both Nova and the Time Ripper, while [[Hunter C-20]] arrests Paradox.\\n\\nThe Others are returned to their respective timelines upon Wilson\\'s request, while Logan is permitted to stay in Wilson\\'s timeline, which no longer deteriorates. Logan hopes for a change of his past, but C-20 tells him that his past is what makes him the anchor needed to save Wilson\\'s timeline, and there is no reason for further change. Logan chooses to retire and live a peaceful life. Before his departure, Wilson takes Logan to meet his friends, and X-23 is invited to the party as well. Encouraged by Logan, Wilson reconciles with Vanessa.\\n\\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Wilson exposes footage of Storm saying the words that led to his murder by Nova.\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n<!-- Order per poster billing block -->\\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson / Deadpool]]:<br />A wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]] to treat terminal cancer.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> The start of the film sees Wilson no longer operating as Deadpool, no longer dating Vanessa, and working as a used car salesman.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Writer [[Rhett Reese]] described Deadpool as a [[wikt:fish out of water|fish-out-of water]] in the film, a lunatic dropped into the \"sane world\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"ReeseJun2022\" /> Reynolds said the audience did not have to take Deadpool seriously, particularly with his [[fourth wall]] breaking and [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]], but he wanted them to be invested in the other characters.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Reynolds also portrays a long-haired, non-scarred variant of Deadpool.<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />\\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]]:<br />A former member of the [[X-Men]] and a mutant with healing abilities, retractable claws, and an [[adamantium]]-infused skeleton.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> This version of the character is from an alternative universe where he let down the inhabitants.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailerCameos\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> This, along with pairing Wolverine with Deadpool, allowed Jackman to explore new aspects of the character than in his prior appearances in [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman said Logan and Wilson were opposites and had a \"quarreling dynamic\",<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> while director [[Shawn Levy]] said their relationship is impacted by both characters being \"haunted with regret\".<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> To prepare for the role, Jackman began a vigorous workout routine that included eating up to 8,000 calories a day.<ref name=\"JackmanWorkout\" /> Jackman also portrays various variants of Wolverine, including: one with the character\\'s comics-accurate height of {{convert|5|ft|3|in|cm}}; Wolverine\\'s gambling alter-ego [[Patch (character)|Patch]], who wears an eyepatch and a white tux; an [[Old Man Logan]] variant; a variant being crucified on a giant X, reminiscent of the cover of \\'\\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\\'\\' (1981) #251; a variant wearing the original brown and tan costume from the comics; and a variant with \"[[glam rock]]-like\" hair and a black costume similar to the [[X-Men: Legacy|1990s \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' comics]].<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />\\n* [[Emma Corrin]] as [[Cassandra Nova]]:<br />A mutant with telekinetic and telepathic powers, who is the twin sister of [[Charles Xavier (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Charles Xavier]] with [[Extraterrestrial life|other-worldly]] origins.<ref name=\"EWMay2024\" /><ref name=\"EWVideoJul2024\" />{{rp|10:43–10:51}} Corrin was excited to play a villain in the film as they had not played many villainous roles before.<ref name=\"CorrinEmpire\" /> Corrin took inspiration from [[Christoph Waltz]]\\'s character [[Hans Landa]] in the film \\'\\'[[Inglourious Basterds]]\\'\\' (2009), while Reynolds highlighted Corrin\\'s humanization and the motivation of the character, comparing Nova\\'s \"mischief, danger, [and] unpredictability\" to the energy of actor [[Gene Wilder]].<ref name=\"CorrinInspiration\" /> Reynolds and Levy explained Nova to Corrin as someone who would endear and charm you to the point that \"you are going to be best friends for life\" only to realize she could easily kill you.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Corrin was interested in having a physical transformation for the role but was told by the studio that this was not required for the character.<ref name=\"CorrinNoPT\" /> Corrin also wanted to pay homage to [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[James McAvoy]]\\'s performances as Xavier in previous \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films, as well as be faithful to Nova\\'s relationship with him from the comics.<ref name=\"CorrinScreenRant\" />\\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]]:<br />A [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) agent who is overseeing a project to speed up the death of the [[Earth-10005]] universe by using the \"Time Ripper\", a machine which can [[mercy kill]] timelines.

The third film was set to include the superhero team [[X-Force]].<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] chose not to return for the sequels due to creative differences with star [[Ryan Reynolds]], and [[David Leitch]] was hired to direct \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018) in November 2016. Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film.<ref name=\"LeitchDP2\" /> In March 2017, \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' and \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' co-writer [[Rhett Reese]] said X-Force would be introduced in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' before starring in a planned spin-off film that would launch \"something bigger\", separate from the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, which would be more personal.<ref name=\"ReeseMar2017\" /> When the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] was announced in December 2017, [[the Walt Disney Company]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] said Reynolds\\'s [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] would be integrated with the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). This was despite those films being rated [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] and the \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films being [[R rating (Motion Picture Association)|R-rated]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxMCU\" /> Iger said Disney was willing to make R-rated \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films \"as long as we let the audiences know what\\'s coming\" and said a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool.<ref name=\"DisneyMarvelR\" /> In May 2018, Reynolds said a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDP3Unsure\" /> Reese and his writing partner [[Paul Wernick]] said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was released, similar to the MCU crossover film \\'\\'[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]\\'\\' (2012) being released between \\'\\'[[Iron Man 2]]\\'\\' (2010) and \\'\\'[[Iron Man 3]]\\'\\' (2013).<ref name=\"May2018IGNReeseWernick\" />\\n\\nAt the end of May 2018, Leitch expressed interest in returning for another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, depending on the schedule.<ref name=\"LeitchDoGMay2018\" /> A third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was believed to be in active development by that August, with production planned to take place in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, rather than in [[Vancouver]], Canada, where the previous films were made.<ref name=\"Aug2018AtlantaProd\" /> \\'\\'[[Once Upon a Deadpool]]\\'\\', a PG-13 version of \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\', was released at the end of the year. It was watched carefully by Disney and [[Marvel Studios]] to see how it might inform their approach to the character in the MCU.<ref name=\"OnceUponADeadpool\" /> While promoting \\'\\'Once Upon a Deadpool\\'\\', Reynolds confirmed that a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was in development and said it would go in a \"completely different direction\".<ref name=\"OUADChina\" /> Reynolds later revealed that they were considering a [[road trip film]] styled after \\'\\'[[Rashomon]]\\'\\' (1950) featuring [[Hugh Jackman]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] character [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]].<ref name=\"ReynoldsRoadTrip\" /> [[Karan Soni]], who portrayed [[Dopinder]] in the first two \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films, reiterated these plans and explained that the film would have focused on Deadpool trying to save Christmas by going on a road trip to the North Pole.<ref name=\"SoniInitialDP3Plans\" /> Jackman had himself envisioned a team-up film with Reynolds inspired by \\'\\'[[48 Hrs.]]\\'\\' (1982) while attending a screening of \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' in 2016, but chose to retire from the role of Wolverine after \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017).<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> In March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several [[Marvel Comics]] characters for Marvel Studios, including [[Deadpool]] and the [[X-Men]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxDealClose\" /><ref name=\"FoxDisneyPressRelease\" /> The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \"on hold\".<ref name=\"FoxMarvelOnHold\" />\\n\\n[[Josh Brolin]], who portrayed [[Cable (character)|Cable]] in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] in the MCU, said in June 2019 that he had discussed his future as Cable with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"BrolinJun2019\" /> In October, [[Zazie Beetz]] said she would be surprised if she did not reprise her \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' role of [[Domino (character)|Domino]] in a future film.<ref name=\"BeetzOct2019\" /> That month, Reese and Wernick said they and Reynolds were taking a \"much-needed rest from Deadpool\" while they waited to hear from Marvel Studios about the franchise\\'s future. They confirmed that another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film would be made, that it would be R-rated like the previous films, and that it would integrate the character with the MCU. Wernick said there was never a set [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film between their exhaustion following \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and the announcement of Fox\\'s acquisition by Disney. Reese said they now had to \"land on the right idea and once we do, I think we\\'ll be off to the races\". The writers felt there would be more characters available in the MCU to act as foils for Deadpool compared to their restricted options among the characters that Fox had control over for the previous films.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickOct2019\" />\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nReynolds revealed in mid-October 2019 that he was meeting with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsMeeting\" /> At that time, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking about how the X-Men and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in general would be added to the franchise. Feige described Reynolds as an \"idea machine\" who pitched many different approaches for the film,<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> including a low budget road trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the [[Sundance Film Festival]],<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to \"[[I Guess That\\'s Why They Call It the Blues]]\" by [[Elton John]].<ref name=\"MusicPitch\" /> Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a \\'\\'Rashomon\\'\\'–style team-up film with Wolverine, which would tell one story from three different perspectives.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> He was told that it would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In December, Reynolds confirmed that the \"whole team\" was actively developing a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film at Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDec2019\" />\\n\\nReynolds and Marvel Studios met with potential writers throughout October 2020, including [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] whose pitch was in line with their intentions for the film. The Molyneux sisters were hired to write the screenplay the next month. Reynolds and Marvel Studios were open to Leitch returning for the film, but he was not expected to due to other commitments throughout 2021 and was not involved in hiring the writers.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> Leitch later confirmed that he met with Marvel for the film, but both parties understood that scheduling and other commitments would prevent him from returning.<ref name=\"LeitchAug2022\" /> In January 2021, Feige reaffirmed that the film would receive an R rating and would be set in the MCU. Reynolds was supervising the scripting process at that time, and Feige said filming would not begin until after 2021 due to Reynolds\\'s busy schedule.<ref name=\"FeigeConfirm\" />\\n\\n[[File:Shawn Levy by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Director Shawn Levy at CinemaCon in April 2024, where he promoted the film]]\\nWhile filming \\'\\'[[The Adam Project]]\\'\\' (2022) with director [[Shawn Levy]], Reynolds approached Levy about working together on the next \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film after they had become frequent collaborators. Reynolds assumed Levy would not be interested due to it being a sequel and not an original work, but Levy was enthused about the idea as long as they had the right story to tell.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> In July 2021, Reynolds and [[Taika Waititi]] promoted their film \\'\\'[[Free Guy]]\\'\\' (2021), also directed by Levy, by appearing as Deadpool and Waititi\\'s MCU character [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]], respectively, in a commercial for that film titled \\'\\'[[Deadpool and Korg React]]\\'\\'.

Feige added that Marvel Studios had a release timeframe in mind for the film.<ref name=\"FeigeAug2021\" /> In November, Beetz and [[Rob Delaney]] expressed interest in returning as their \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' characters Domino and Peter,<ref name=\"BeetzNov2021\" /><ref name=\"DelaneyNov2021\" /> but Beetz ultimately did not return for the third film.<ref name=\"NoBeetz\" /> Also in November, Reynolds said they were \"plugging away\" at the film.<ref name=\"ReynoldsNov2021\" />\\n\\nLevy was revealed to be directing the film in March 2022,<ref name=\"LevyMar2022THR\" /><ref name=\"LevyMar2022Variety\" /> and said filming would not begin until after 2022 due to his busy schedule through the remainder of the year.<ref name=\"LevyNo2022Filming\" /> Reese and Wernick were hired to rewrite the screenplay,<ref name=\"LevyMar2022THR\" /><ref name=\"LevyMar2022Variety\" /> and said they were excited to use MCU elements in the film.

They would not confirm whether they were starting from scratch or reworking the previous draft by the Molyneux sisters.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickJun2022\" /> In June, [[Ray Chan (art director)|Raymond Chan]] was revealed to be the production designer after working on the [[Disney+]] MCU miniseries \\'\\'[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]\\'\\' (2021).<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Feige said in July that the film would be elevated from the first two in a similar way to other third installments of MCU film series, such as \\'\\'[[Captain America: Civil War]]\\'\\' (2016), \\'\\'[[Thor: Ragnarok]]\\'\\' (2017), and \\'\\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\\'\\' (2018).<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2022\" />\\n\\nLevy and Reynolds worked on the script with Reese, Wernick, and [[Zeb Wells]],<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> who previously worked on the MCU miniseries \\'\\'[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]\\'\\' (2022) and \\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies (miniseries)|Marvel Zombies]]\\'\\' (2024), and the film \\'\\'[[The Marvels]]\\'\\' (2023).<ref name=\"Disney+DayDeadline\" /><ref name=\"WellsPastMCUWork\" /> They all began to feel that they did not have an original story that was not derivative of the other \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films. Levy explained that they felt the film had to be \"deserving\" of being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film set within the MCU, while still feeling \"grounded because this is an earthbound, gritty, realistic superhero franchise\". Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea,<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea for the film.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In August 2022, Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film. Reynolds was preparing for a meeting with Feige to discuss how to proceed given their lack of story ideas, and realized that including Wolverine would solve many of the issues they were coming up against.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman had a change of heart, after being content with his decision to retire as Wolverine for several years, and decided that a team-up film with Reynolds \"could be so much fun; I\\'ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I\\'ve ever done\".<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> Feige advised Jackman not to return, as he felt Wolverine\\'s death in \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' was the \"greatest ending in history\" and did not want to undo that. He was won over by the idea that Jackman would portray a new version of Wolverine, and Jackman confirmed that he wanted to return after taking a long drive to think about it.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" />\\n\\nReynolds announced in September 2022 that Jackman would return as Wolverine for \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\', which was set for release on September 6, 2024.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> The pair said the film would avoid affecting the events of \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' by using a [[narrative device]] from Marvel Studios that allowed different versions of characters to move around timelines.<ref name=\"JackmanDifferentLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanDec2022\" /> Levy said preserving \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'{{\\'s}} legacy was top priority for the creative team.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman reached out to \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' director [[James Mangold]] to inform him of the film\\'s story and said Mangold was both enthusiastic about the idea and relieved that \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' would not be impacted.<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> Alongside Feige, Reynolds and Levy produced the film through their respective production companies [[Maximum Effort]] and [[21 Laps Entertainment]],<ref name=\"Corrin\" /><ref name=\"MaximumEffort\" /><ref name=\"21Laps\" /> as did \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]].<ref name=\"TrailerViews\" /> [[Simon Kinberg]] served as an executive producer after producing the previous \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films and some \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films.<ref name=\"Kinberg\" /><ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /><ref name=\"DPWolverineMarvel\" /> He said the film had been authored by Levy, Reynolds, and Feige, and they all cared deeply about \\'\\'Logan\\'\\', Deadpool, and Wolverine.<ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /> Levy added that the legacies of Deadpool and Wolverine informed the film\\'s story and themes.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Jackman said the film may not be titled \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\',<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> with Reynolds later referring to it as \"The Deadpool/Wolverine film\",<ref name=\"ReynoldsVarietyNov2022\" /> and Jackman referring to it as \\'\\'Wolverine and Deadpool\\'\\'.<ref name=\"JackmanJan2023\" /> Levy said the creative team were discussing multiple options for the title, and he had at times referred to it as \\'\\'Deadpool Versus Wolverine\\'\\', \\'\\'Deadpool and Wolverine\\'\\', and \\'\\'Deadpool 3 with Wolverine\\'\\'.<ref name=\"NoTitle\" /> The film\\'s official title was announced as \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' in February 2024,<ref name=\"EWSuperBowl\" /> with Levy acknowledging that it was the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film but he did not want to call it \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\' because it is a \"two-hander character adventure\" that focuses on both characters.<ref name=\"LevyTitleApr2024\" /> Despite this, Reynolds said the film was tonally still a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, with violence, swearing, and \"[[wikt:meta|meta]] mayhem\".

Marvel had been considering Corrin since late 2022 but had to work through scheduling issues with their other commitments before they signed on.<ref name=\"Corrin\" /> Corrin was cast after Levy saw their performance in a stage production of [[Virginia Woolf]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]\\'\\'.<ref name=\"CorrinEmpire\" /> In March, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), [[Mobius M.

They said these were conservative projections and it was likely to open higher. \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' noted that no R-rated film had ever opened domestically over $200&nbsp;million, with the record opening for an R-rated film being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' with $132.4&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"QuorumBOTracking\" /> Three weeks ahead of release, multiple tracking services projected the film would open between $160–165&nbsp;million, which would still be a record opening for an R-rated film and the best opening for a 2024 release. \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' said Disney was expecting an opening in this range, and added that presale tickets was at $19&nbsp;million. Quorum reaffirmed its projection of a $200+ million opening at that time.<ref name=\"Deadline3WeeksBOTracking\" />\\n\\nThe week of its release, \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' projected a worldwide opening between $340–360&nbsp;million. A noted increase from prior, lesser predictions which did not consider the substantial walk-up business observed from Latino and Hispanic viewers, it was a factor from which other movies heavily benefited during that summer. The larger prediction included an estimated contribution from that demographic, as well as consideration for the prospects of the film being viewed by a younger audience. At that point, ticket pre-sales for the United States and Canada stood at $35&nbsp;million, a number taken that last Friday, July 19.<ref name=\"DeadlineOpeningBOTracking\" />\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\n{{RT prose|80|7.1|152|Ryan Reynolds makes himself at home in the MCU with acerbic wit while Hugh Jackman provides an Adamantium backbone to proceedings in \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\', an irreverent romp with a surprising soft spot for a bygone era of superhero movies.|ref=y|access-date=July 24, 2024}} {{Metacritic film prose|55|47|ref=y|access-date=July 23, 2024}}\\n\\n\\'\\'[[IGN]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Tom Jorgensen praised Jackman\\'s return to the character. He felt slightly disappointed that Deadpool did not top the lewdness his previous jokes from the first two films and felt the exposition was slow, but he appreciated its function as a buddy comedy.<ref name=\"IGNReview\" /> Writing for \\'\\'[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]\\'\\', Olly Richards gave the film four stars out of five. He praised the film for \"do[ing] all it can to bring everyone along for the ride, including those who don\\'t know their Professor X from their X-23\".<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> Brian Lowry wrote for [[CNN]] that it showcased Marvel Studios\\'s willingness to partake in self-deprecation, and a respect for the superhero films of the 2000s.<ref name=\"CNNReview\" /> In a very positive review, \\'\\'[[Deadline Hollywood]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Pete Hammond felt that the collaboration between the film\\'s titular characters, which resembled \\'\\'[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]\\'\\' (2021) and \\'\\'[[Midnight Run]]\\'\\' (1988), \"works {{em|beyond}} your wildest screen-team dreams\", praised how director Levy leveraged the best from the stars, and noted that Deadpool\\'s raunchy jokes \"come [...] so rapid-fire this time, even more so than in the first two \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' [films].\"<ref name=\"DeadlineReview\" />\\n\\nReviewing for \\'\\'[[Collider (website)|Collider]]\\'\\', Ross Bonaime wrote that with the integration of Deadpool into the larger Marvel property, the character finally started to live up to his full potential. He called him \"far more violent, foul-mouthed, and irreverent towards its surroundings than ever before\", and praised Disney\\'s allowance for the character to be expressed unhindered.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> The \\'\\'[[Chicago Sun-Times]]\\'\\' columnist Richard Roeper, who gave the film three out of four stars, highlighted the star performances, violence, humor, and [[Easter eggs (media)|Easter eggs]], which he described as more abundant than the ones \"on the White House lawn on a Monday in April\", though he threw shade at the \"usual\" plot and \"paper-thin\" story.<ref name=\"ChicagoSTReview\" /> [[Associated Press]] writer Krysta Fauria said that while the genre\\'s critics would not be won over, the film\\'s increased focus on its self-aware genre criticism helped it find a \"sweet spot\" in being an improvement over its predecessors. He felt that Levy was benefited in the increased budget and that the homoerotic yet hate-filled relationship between the titular characters was enticing.<ref name=\"AssociatedPressReview\" />\\n\\nThe \\'\\'[[San Francisco Chronicle]]\\'\\' movie critic Mick LaSalle bemoaned the lack of a plot, which in his opinion would have worked for Deadpool to subvert were there one that the audience could relate to.<ref name=\"SFCReview\" /> \\'\\'[[The Hollywood Reporter]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s David Rooney thought that the meta jokes were \"dialed up to radioactive levels\" and that the critical interpretation remained largely up to what the audience wanted to get out of the film.<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> In one-star reviews for the film, Donald Clarke for \\'\\'[[The Irish Times]]\\'\\' wrote that the film is \"the most relentlessly juvenile entry in a sequence that has rarely been confused with [[Ingmar Bergman]]\\'s \\'\\'Faith\\'\\' trilogy\" and chided that the 1966 \\'\\'[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]\\'\\' television series had better humor;<ref name=\"IrishTimesReview\" /> Robbie Collin, chief film critic for \\'\\'[[The Daily Telegraph]]\\'\\' wrote that \"for all the script\\'s winking guffaws about the series\\' mishap-strewn detour into the multiverse, it can\\'t relinquish its nothing-that-happens-here-actually-matters safety net.\"<ref

It is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 34th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and the sequel to \\'\\'[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]\\'\\' (2016) and \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018). The film is directed by [[Shawn Levy]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Rhett Reese]], [[Paul Wernick]], and [[Zeb Wells]]. Reynolds and [[Hugh Jackman]] star as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] and [[Logan (film character)|Wolverine]], respectively, alongside [[Emma Corrin]] and [[Matthew Macfadyen]]. In the film, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) pulls Deadpool from his quiet life and sets him on a mission with Wolverine that will change the history of the MCU.\\n\\nDevelopment on a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film began at [[20th Century Fox]] by November 2016, but was placed on hold after the studio was [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquired by Disney]] in March 2019. Control of the character was transferred to Marvel Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds. It integrates Deadpool with the MCU and retains the [[R-rating (Motion Picture Association)|R rating]] of the previous films, making it the first MCU film to have such a rating. [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] joined in November 2020 as writers. Reese and Wernick returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022, when Levy was hired as director. They, along with Reynolds and Wells, had difficulty figuring out the film\\'s story until Jackman decided to reprise his role as Wolverine from Fox\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] in August 2022. Filming began in May 2023 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, with additional filming in [[Norfolk]] and at Bovingdon Film Studios. Production was suspended in July due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]], but resumed in November and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in January 2024. The film\\'s title was revealed a month later.\\n\\n\\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' premiered on July 22, 2024, at the [[David H.

The film recieved positive reviews from critics who praised the performances and chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman.\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nIn 2018, [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson]] of [[Earth-10005]]{{efn|The film gives the name \"Earth-10005\" to the main reality of [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />}} uses [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]\\'s time-traveling device to travel to [[Earth-616 (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Earth-616]], the \"[[Sacred Timeline]]\", where he attempts to join the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], but he is rejected.\\n\\nIn 2024, Wilson has retired from being the masked mercenary known as Deadpool and began to work as an used car salesman after breaking up with his girlfriend [[Vanessa Carlysle]]. During his birthday party, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) captures Wilson and delivers him to [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]], who offers him to join Earth-616. However, Paradox also reveals that Wilson\\'s timeline would deteriorate as a result of the death of [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett]],{{Efn|name=Logan|As depicted in \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017)}} who is revealed to be the timeline\\'s \"anchor being\". Wilson steals Paradox\\'s [[TemPad]] to travel the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] and find a variant of Logan to save his timeline.\\n\\nAfter encountering various Logan variants, Wilson takes one back to the TVA, where he learns that this particular Logan destroyed his own universe before Paradox prunes them both into the [[Void (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Void]]. Wilson and Logan fight before they and [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]{{Efn|name=JohnnyStorm|from \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\\'\\' (2005)}} are captured and sent to [[Cassandra Nova]], who Logan identifies as the twin sister of [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]]. Upon arriving at Nova\\'s lair, she kills Storm and tries to puzzle Wilson with the feeling of not being needed, before [[Alioth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alioth]] appears. Wilson and Logan escape before Alioth can consume them.\\n\\nFollowing their escape, Wilson and Logan are directed by a variant of Wilson to travel to the Void\\'s borderlands to join the resistance against Nova and her forces, but Logan chastises Wilson for hiding the fact that Wilson knew how to return them to their original timelines. Arriving at the borderlands, Wilson and Logan meet the resistance members [[Elektra (character)|Elektra]],{{Efn|name=Elektra|from \\'\\'[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]\\'\\' (2005)}} [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]],{{Efn|name=Blade|from \\'\\'[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]\\'\\' (1998)}} [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]],{{Efn|name=Gambit|from the aborted \\'\\'Gambit\\'\\' film, planned as a spin-off to \\'\\'[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]\\'\\' (2009)}} and [[X-23]], nicknamed the \"Others\" by Wilson. The Others want to team up with Wilson and Logan to fight Nova, but Logan refuses to cooperate, though he eventually relents after a conversation with X-23 about the tragic past making him the worst Wolverine in the multiverse.\\n\\nWilson, Logan, and the Others go to confront Nova, who has Logan mentally incapacitated, but Wilson places [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]]\\'s helmet on her to block her powers. [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] shoots Nova and reveals himself as Paradox\\'s sleeper agent assigned to keep her inside the Void. Logan persuades Wilson to remove the helmet to allow Nova to heal, and guarantees that Xavier would help her if he knows she still exists. In exchange, Nova uses a sling ring from a [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Doctor Strange]] variant to open a portal for the duo to travel to Wade\\'s timeline.\\n\\nUpon arriving on Earth-10005, Wilson and Logan find that Paradox is using the Time Ripper, a device Paradox developed to destroy Wilson\\'s timeline without permission from his superior. Nova quickly learns this from the executed Pyro as well, as she arrives through another portal and kidnaps Paradox. Wilson and Logan battle the [[Deadpool Corps]], an army of Deadpool variants coming from the portal, before Nova takes control of the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines as revenge for Paradox\\'s betrayal. Paradox tells Wilson and Logan that one can disrupt the power flow of the Time Ripper at the cost of their life. Using their own bodies as a conductor, Wilson and Logan destroy both Nova and the Time Ripper, while [[Hunter C-20]] arrests Paradox.\\n\\nThe Others are returned to their respective timelines upon Wilson\\'s request, while Logan is permitted to stay in Wilson\\'s timeline, which no longer deteriorates. Logan hopes for a change of his past, but C-20 tells him that his past is what makes him the anchor needed to save Wilson\\'s timeline, and there is no reason for further change. Logan chooses to retire and live a peaceful life. Before his departure, Wilson takes Logan to meet his friends, and X-23 is invited to the party as well. Encouraged by Logan, Wilson reconciles with Carlysle.\\n\\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Wilson exposes footage of Storm saying the words that led to his murder by Nova. It’s followed by a tribute to [[20th Century Studios|Fox]]’s [[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]] franchise.\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n<!-- Order per poster billing block -->\\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson / Deadpool]]:<br />A wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]] to treat terminal cancer.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> The start of the film sees Wilson no longer operating as Deadpool, no longer dating Vanessa, and working as an used car salesman.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Writer [[Rhett Reese]] described Deadpool as a [[wikt:fish out of water|fish-out-of water]] in the film, a lunatic dropped into the \"sane world\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"ReeseJun2022\" /> Reynolds said the audience did not have to take Deadpool seriously, particularly with his [[fourth wall]] breaking and [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]], but he wanted them to be invested in the other characters.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Reynolds also portrays a long-haired, non-scarred variant of Deadpool.<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />\\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]]:<br />A former member of the [[X-Men]] and a mutant with healing abilities, retractable claws, and an [[adamantium]]-infused skeleton.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> This version of the character is from an alternative universe where he let down the inhabitants.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailerCameos\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> This, along with pairing Wolverine with Deadpool, allowed Jackman to explore new aspects of the character than in his prior appearances in [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman said Logan and Wilson were opposites and had a \"quarreling dynamic\",<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> while director [[Shawn Levy]] said their relationship is impacted by both characters being \"haunted with regret\".<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> To prepare for the role, Jackman began a vigorous workout routine that included eating up to 8,000 calories a day.<ref name=\"JackmanWorkout\" /> Jackman also portrays various variants of Wolverine, including: one with the character\\'s comics-accurate height of {{convert|5|ft|3|in|cm}}; Wolverine\\'s gambling alter-ego [[Patch (character)|Patch]], who wears an eyepatch and a white tux; an [[Old Man Logan]] variant; a variant being crucified on a giant X, reminiscent of the cover of \\'\\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\\'\\' (1981) #251; a variant wearing the original brown and tan costume from the comics; and a variant with \"[[glam rock]]-like\" hair and a black costume similar to the [[X-Men: Legacy|1990s \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' comics]].<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />\\n* [[Emma Corrin]] as [[Cassandra Nova]]:<br />A mutant with telekinetic and telepathic powers, who is the twin sister of [[Charles Xavier (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Charles Xavier]] with [[Extraterrestrial life|other-worldly]] origins.<ref name=\"EWMay2024\" /><ref name=\"EWVideoJul2024\" />{{rp|10:43–10:51}} Corrin was excited to play a villain in the film as they had not played many villainous roles before.<ref name=\"CorrinEmpire\" /> Corrin took inspiration from [[Christoph Waltz]]\\'s character [[Hans Landa]] in the film \\'\\'[[Inglourious Basterds]]\\'\\' (2009), while Reynolds highlighted Corrin\\'s humanization and the motivation of the character, comparing Nova\\'s \"mischief, danger, [and] unpredictability\" to the energy of actor [[Gene Wilder]].<ref name=\"CorrinInspiration\" /> Reynolds and Levy explained Nova to Corrin as someone who would endear and charm you to the point that \"you are going to be best friends for life\" only to realize she could easily kill you.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Corrin was interested in having a physical transformation for the role but was told by the studio that this was not required for the character.<ref name=\"CorrinNoPT\" /> Corrin also wanted to pay homage to [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[James McAvoy]]\\'s performances as Xavier in previous \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films, as well as be faithful to Nova\\'s relationship with him from the comics.<ref name=\"CorrinScreenRant\" />\\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]]:<br />A [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) agent who is overseeing a project to speed up the death of the [[Earth-10005]] universe by using the \"Time Ripper\", a machine which can [[mercy kill]] timelines.

The third film was set to include the superhero team [[X-Force]].<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] chose not to return for the sequels due to creative differences with star [[Ryan Reynolds]], and [[David Leitch]] was hired to direct \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018) in November 2016. Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film.<ref name=\"LeitchDP2\" /> In March 2017, \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' and \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' co-writer [[Rhett Reese]] said X-Force would be introduced in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' before starring in a planned spin-off film that would launch \"something bigger\", separate from the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, which would be more personal.<ref name=\"ReeseMar2017\" /> When the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] was announced in December 2017, [[the Walt Disney Company]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] said Reynolds\\'s [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] would be integrated with the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). This was despite those films being rated [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] and the \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films being [[R rating (Motion Picture Association)|R-rated]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxMCU\" /> Iger said Disney was willing to make R-rated \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films \"as long as we let the audiences know what\\'s coming\" and said a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool.<ref name=\"DisneyMarvelR\" /> In May 2018, Reynolds said a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDP3Unsure\" /> Reese and his writing partner [[Paul Wernick]] said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was released, similar to the MCU crossover film \\'\\'[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]\\'\\' (2012) being released between \\'\\'[[Iron Man 2]]\\'\\' (2010) and \\'\\'[[Iron Man 3]]\\'\\' (2013).<ref name=\"May2018IGNReeseWernick\" />\\n\\nAt the end of May 2018, Leitch expressed interest in returning for another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, depending on the schedule.<ref name=\"LeitchDoGMay2018\" /> A third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was believed to be in active development by that August, with production planned to take place in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, rather than in [[Vancouver]], Canada, where the previous films were made.<ref name=\"Aug2018AtlantaProd\" /> \\'\\'[[Once Upon a Deadpool]]\\'\\', a PG-13 version of \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\', was released at the end of the year. It was watched carefully by Disney and [[Marvel Studios]] to see how it might inform their approach to the character in the MCU.<ref name=\"OnceUponADeadpool\" /> While promoting \\'\\'Once Upon a Deadpool\\'\\', Reynolds confirmed that a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was in development and said it would go in a \"completely different direction\".<ref name=\"OUADChina\" /> Reynolds later revealed that they were considering a [[road trip film]] styled after \\'\\'[[Rashomon]]\\'\\' (1950) featuring [[Hugh Jackman]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] character [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]].<ref name=\"ReynoldsRoadTrip\" /> [[Karan Soni]], who portrayed [[Dopinder]] in the first two \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films, reiterated these plans and explained that the film would have focused on Deadpool trying to save Christmas by going on a road trip to the North Pole.<ref name=\"SoniInitialDP3Plans\" /> Jackman had himself envisioned a team-up film with Reynolds inspired by \\'\\'[[48 Hrs.]]\\'\\' (1982) while attending a screening of \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' in 2016, but chose to retire from the role of Wolverine after \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017).<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> In March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several [[Marvel Comics]] characters for Marvel Studios, including [[Deadpool]] and the [[X-Men]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxDealClose\" /><ref name=\"FoxDisneyPressRelease\" /> The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \"on hold\".<ref name=\"FoxMarvelOnHold\" />\\n\\n[[Josh Brolin]], who portrayed [[Cable (character)|Cable]] in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] in the MCU, said in June 2019 that he had discussed his future as Cable with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"BrolinJun2019\" /> In October, [[Zazie Beetz]] said she would be surprised if she did not reprise her \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' role of [[Domino (character)|Domino]] in a future film.<ref name=\"BeetzOct2019\" /> That month, Reese and Wernick said they and Reynolds were taking a \"much-needed rest from Deadpool\" while they waited to hear from Marvel Studios about the franchise\\'s future. They confirmed that another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film would be made, that it would be R-rated like the previous films, and that it would integrate the character with the MCU. Wernick said there was never a set [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film between their exhaustion following \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and the announcement of Fox\\'s acquisition by Disney. Reese said they now had to \"land on the right idea and once we do, I think we\\'ll be off to the races\". The writers felt there would be more characters available in the MCU to act as foils for Deadpool compared to their restricted options among the characters that Fox had control over for the previous films.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickOct2019\" />\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nReynolds revealed in mid-October 2019 that he was meeting with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsMeeting\" /> At that time, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking about how the X-Men and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in general would be added to the franchise. Feige described Reynolds as an \"idea machine\" who pitched many different approaches for the film,<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> including a low budget road trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the [[Sundance Film Festival]],<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to \"[[I Guess That\\'s Why They Call It the Blues]]\" by [[Elton John]].<ref name=\"MusicPitch\" /> Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a \\'\\'Rashomon\\'\\'–style team-up film with Wolverine, which would tell one story from three different perspectives.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> He was told that it would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In December, Reynolds confirmed that the \"whole team\" was actively developing a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film at Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDec2019\" />\\n\\nReynolds and Marvel Studios met with potential writers throughout October 2020, including [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] whose pitch was in line with their intentions for the film. The Molyneux sisters were hired to write the screenplay the next month. Reynolds and Marvel Studios were open to Leitch returning for the film, but he was not expected to due to other commitments throughout 2021 and was not involved in hiring the writers.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> Leitch later confirmed that he met with Marvel for the film, but both parties understood that scheduling and other commitments would prevent him from returning.<ref name=\"LeitchAug2022\" /> In January 2021, Feige reaffirmed that the film would receive an R rating and would be set in the MCU. Reynolds was supervising the scripting process at that time, and Feige said filming would not begin until after 2021 due to Reynolds\\'s busy schedule.<ref name=\"FeigeConfirm\" />\\n\\n[[File:Shawn Levy by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Director Shawn Levy at CinemaCon in April 2024, where he promoted the film]]\\nWhile filming \\'\\'[[The Adam Project]]\\'\\' (2022) with director [[Shawn Levy]], Reynolds approached Levy about working together on the next \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film after they had become frequent collaborators. Reynolds assumed Levy would not be interested due to it being a sequel and not an original work, but Levy was enthused about the idea as long as they had the right story to tell.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> In July 2021, Reynolds and [[Taika Waititi]] promoted their film \\'\\'[[Free Guy]]\\'\\' (2021), also directed by Levy, by appearing as Deadpool and Waititi\\'s MCU character [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]], respectively, in a commercial for that film titled \\'\\'[[Deadpool and Korg React]]\\'\\'. Deadpool, who often breaks the [[fourth wall]], discusses joining the MCU with Korg in the commercial.<ref name=\"VarietyFreeGuyAd\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFreeGuyAd\" /> The next month, Reynolds said he expected filming to begin in 2022,<ref name=\"ReynoldsAug2021\" /> which Feige soon confirmed. Feige added that Marvel Studios had a release timeframe in mind for the film.<ref name=\"FeigeAug2021\" /> In November, Beetz and [[Rob Delaney]] expressed interest in returning as their \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' characters Domino and Peter,<ref name=\"BeetzNov2021\" /><ref name=\"DelaneyNov2021\" /> but Beetz ultimately did not return for the third film.<ref name=\"NoBeetz\" /> Also in November, Reynolds said they were \"plugging away\" at the film.<ref name=\"ReynoldsNov2021\" />\\n\\nLevy was revealed to be directing the film in March 2022,<ref name=\"LevyMar2022THR\" /><ref name=\"LevyMar2022Variety\" /> and said filming would not begin until after 2022 due to his busy schedule through the remainder of the year.<ref name=\"LevyNo2022Filming\" /> Reese and Wernick were hired to rewrite the screenplay,<ref name=\"LevyMar2022THR\" /><ref name=\"LevyMar2022Variety\" /> and said they were excited to use MCU elements in the film. They added that Disney and Marvel were supportive of jokes about the MCU that they were writing for Deadpool given the success of the previous films. They would not confirm whether they were starting from scratch or reworking the previous draft by the Molyneux sisters.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickJun2022\" /> In June, [[Ray Chan (art director)|Raymond Chan]] was revealed to be the production designer after working on the [[Disney+]] MCU miniseries \\'\\'[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]\\'\\' (2021).<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Feige said in July that the film would be elevated from the first two in a similar way to other third installments of MCU film series, such as \\'\\'[[Captain America: Civil War]]\\'\\' (2016), \\'\\'[[Thor: Ragnarok]]\\'\\' (2017), and \\'\\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\\'\\' (2018).<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2022\" />\\n\\nLevy and Reynolds worked on the script with Reese, Wernick, and [[Zeb Wells]],<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> who previously worked on the MCU miniseries \\'\\'[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]\\'\\' (2022) and \\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies (miniseries)|Marvel Zombies]]\\'\\' (2024), and the film \\'\\'[[The Marvels]]\\'\\' (2023).<ref name=\"Disney+DayDeadline\" /><ref name=\"WellsPastMCUWork\" /> They all began to feel that they did not have an original story that was not derivative of the other \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films. Levy explained that they felt the film had to be \"deserving\" of being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film set within the MCU, while still feeling \"grounded because this is an earthbound, gritty, realistic superhero franchise\". Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea,<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea for the film.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In August 2022, Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film. Reynolds was preparing for a meeting with Feige to discuss how to proceed given their lack of story ideas, and realized that including Wolverine would solve many of the issues they were coming up against.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman had a change of heart, after being content with his decision to retire as Wolverine for several years, and decided that a team-up film with Reynolds \"could be so much fun; I\\'ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I\\'ve ever done\".<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> Feige advised Jackman not to return, as he felt Wolverine\\'s death in \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' was the \"greatest ending in history\" and did not want to undo that. He was won over by the idea that Jackman would portray a new version of Wolverine, and Jackman confirmed that he wanted to return after taking a long drive to think about it.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" />\\n\\nReynolds announced in September 2022 that Jackman would return as Wolverine for \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\', which was set for release on September 6, 2024.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> The pair said the film would avoid affecting the events of \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' by using a [[narrative device]] from Marvel Studios that allowed different versions of characters to move around timelines.<ref name=\"JackmanDifferentLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanDec2022\" /> Levy said preserving \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'{{\\'s}} legacy was top priority for the creative team.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman reached out to \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' director [[James Mangold]] to inform him of the film\\'s story and said Mangold was both enthusiastic about the idea and relieved that \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' would not be impacted.<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> Alongside Feige, Reynolds and Levy produced the film through their respective production companies [[Maximum Effort]] and [[21 Laps Entertainment]],<ref name=\"Corrin\" /><ref name=\"MaximumEffort\" /><ref name=\"21Laps\" /> as did \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]].<ref name=\"TrailerViews\" /> [[Simon Kinberg]] served as an executive producer after producing the previous \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films and some \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films.<ref name=\"Kinberg\" /><ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /><ref name=\"DPWolverineMarvel\" /> He said the film had been authored by Levy, Reynolds, and Feige, and they all cared deeply about \\'\\'Logan\\'\\', Deadpool, and Wolverine.<ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /> Levy added that the legacies of Deadpool and Wolverine informed the film\\'s story and themes.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Jackman said the film may not be titled \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\',<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> with Reynolds later referring to it as \"The Deadpool/Wolverine film\",<ref name=\"ReynoldsVarietyNov2022\" /> and Jackman referring to it as \\'\\'Wolverine and Deadpool\\'\\'.<ref name=\"JackmanJan2023\" /> Levy said the creative team were discussing multiple options for the title, and he had at times referred to it as \\'\\'Deadpool Versus Wolverine\\'\\', \\'\\'Deadpool and Wolverine\\'\\', and \\'\\'Deadpool 3 with Wolverine\\'\\'.<ref name=\"NoTitle\" /> The film\\'s official title was announced as \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' in February 2024,<ref name=\"EWSuperBowl\" /> with Levy acknowledging that it was the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film but he did not want to call it \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\' because it is a \"two-hander character adventure\" that focuses on both characters.<ref name=\"LevyTitleApr2024\" /> Despite this, Reynolds said the film was tonally still a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, with violence, swearing, and \"[[wikt:meta|meta]] mayhem\".

Marvel had been considering Corrin since late 2022 but had to work through scheduling issues with their other commitments before they signed on.<ref name=\"Corrin\" /> Corrin was cast after Levy saw their performance in a stage production of [[Virginia Woolf]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]\\'\\'.<ref name=\"CorrinEmpire\" /> In March, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), [[Mobius M.

They said these were conservative projections and it was likely to open higher. \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' noted that no R-rated film had ever opened domestically over $200&nbsp;million, with the record opening for an R-rated film being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' with $132.4&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"QuorumBOTracking\" /> Three weeks ahead of release, multiple tracking services projected the film would open between $160–165&nbsp;million, which would still be a record opening for an R-rated film and the best opening for a 2024 release. \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' said Disney was expecting an opening in this range, and added that presale tickets was at $19&nbsp;million. Quorum reaffirmed its projection of a $200+ million opening at that time.<ref name=\"Deadline3WeeksBOTracking\" />\\n\\nThe week of its release, \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' projected a worldwide opening between $340–360&nbsp;million. A noted increase from prior, lesser predictions which did not consider the substantial walk-up business observed from Latino and Hispanic viewers, it was a factor from which other movies heavily benefited during that summer. The larger prediction included an estimated contribution from that demographic, as well as consideration for the prospects of the film being viewed by a younger audience. At that point, ticket pre-sales for the United States and Canada stood at $35&nbsp;million, a number taken that last Friday, July 19.<ref name=\"DeadlineOpeningBOTracking\" />\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\n{{RT prose|81|7.1|157|Ryan Reynolds makes himself at home in the MCU with acerbic wit while Hugh Jackman provides an Adamantium backbone to proceedings in \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\', an irreverent romp with a surprising soft spot for a bygone era of superhero movies.|ref=y|access-date=July 24, 2024}} {{Metacritic film prose|55|47|ref=y|access-date=July 23, 2024}}\\n\\n\\'\\'[[IGN]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Tom Jorgensen praised Jackman\\'s return to the character. He felt slightly disappointed that Deadpool did not top the lewdness his previous jokes from the first two films and felt the exposition was slow, but he appreciated its function as a buddy comedy.<ref name=\"IGNReview\" /> Writing for \\'\\'[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]\\'\\', Olly Richards gave the film four stars out of five. He praised the film for \"do[ing] all it can to bring everyone along for the ride, including those who don\\'t know their Professor X from their X-23\".<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> Brian Lowry wrote for [[CNN]] that it showcased Marvel Studios\\'s willingness to partake in self-deprecation, and a respect for the superhero films of the 2000s.<ref name=\"CNNReview\" /> In a very positive review, \\'\\'[[Deadline Hollywood]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Pete Hammond felt that the collaboration between the film\\'s titular characters, which resembled \\'\\'[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]\\'\\' (2021) and \\'\\'[[Midnight Run]]\\'\\' (1988), \"works {{em|beyond}} your wildest screen-team dreams\", praised how director Levy leveraged the best from the stars, and noted that Deadpool\\'s raunchy jokes \"come [...] so rapid-fire this time, even more so than in the first two \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' [films].\"<ref name=\"DeadlineReview\" />\\n\\nReviewing for \\'\\'[[Collider (website)|Collider]]\\'\\', Ross Bonaime wrote that with the integration of Deadpool into the larger Marvel property, the character finally started to live up to his full potential. He called him \"far more violent, foul-mouthed, and irreverent towards its surroundings than ever before\", and praised Disney\\'s allowance for the character to be expressed unhindered.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> The \\'\\'[[Chicago Sun-Times]]\\'\\' columnist Richard Roeper, who gave the film three out of four stars, highlighted the star performances, violence, humor, and [[Easter eggs (media)|Easter eggs]], which he described as more abundant than the ones \"on the White House lawn on a Monday in April\", though he threw shade at the \"usual\" plot and \"paper-thin\" story.<ref name=\"ChicagoSTReview\" /> [[Associated Press]] writer Krysta Fauria said that while the genre\\'s critics would not be won over, the film\\'s increased focus on its self-aware genre criticism helped it find a \"sweet spot\" in being an improvement over its predecessors. He felt that Levy was benefited in the increased budget and that the homoerotic yet hate-filled relationship between the titular characters was enticing.<ref name=\"AssociatedPressReview\" />\\n\\nThe \\'\\'[[San Francisco Chronicle]]\\'\\' movie critic Mick LaSalle bemoaned the lack of a plot, which in his opinion would have worked for Deadpool to subvert were there one that the audience could relate to.<ref name=\"SFCReview\" /> \\'\\'[[The Hollywood Reporter]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s David Rooney thought that the meta jokes were \"dialed up to radioactive levels\" and that the critical interpretation remained largely up to what the audience wanted to get out of the film.<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> In one-star reviews for the film, Donald Clarke for \\'\\'[[The Irish Times]]\\'\\' wrote that the film is \"the most relentlessly juvenile entry in a sequence that has rarely been confused with [[Ingmar Bergman]]\\'s \\'\\'Faith\\'\\' trilogy\" and chided that the 1966 \\'\\'[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]\\'\\' television series had better humor;<ref name=\"IrishTimesReview\" /> Robbie Collin, chief film critic for \\'\\'[[The Daily Telegraph]]\\'\\' wrote that \"for all the script\\'s winking guffaws about the series\\' mishap-strewn detour into the multiverse, it can\\'t relinquish its nothing-that-happens-here-actually-matters safety net.\"<ref

It is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 34th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and the sequel to \\'\\'[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]\\'\\' (2016) and \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018). The film is directed by [[Shawn Levy]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Rhett Reese]], [[Paul Wernick]], and [[Zeb Wells]]. Reynolds and [[Hugh Jackman]] star as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] and [[Logan (film character)|Wolverine]], respectively, alongside [[Emma Corrin]] and [[Matthew Macfadyen]]. In the film, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) pulls Deadpool from his quiet life and sets him on a mission with Wolverine that will change the history of the MCU.\\n\\nDevelopment on a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film began at [[20th Century Fox]] by November 2016, but was placed on hold after the studio was [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquired by Disney]] in March 2019. Control of the character was transferred to Marvel Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds. It integrates Deadpool with the MCU and retains the [[R-rating (Motion Picture Association)|R rating]] of the previous films, making it the first MCU film to have such a rating. [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] joined in November 2020 as writers. Reese and Wernick returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022, when Levy was hired as director. They, along with Reynolds and Wells, had difficulty figuring out the film\\'s story until Jackman decided to reprise his role as Wolverine from Fox\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] in August 2022. Filming began in May 2023 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, with additional filming in [[Norfolk]] and at Bovingdon Film Studios. Production was suspended in July due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]], but resumed in November and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in January 2024.

Koch Theater]] in New York City, and is scheduled to be released in the United States on July 26, 2024, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Five|Phase Five]] of the MCU.\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nIn 2018, [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson]] of [[Earth-10005]]{{efn|The film gives the name \"Earth-10005\" to the main reality of [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />}} uses [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]\\'s time-traveling device to travel to [[Earth-616 (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Earth-616]], the \"[[Sacred Timeline]]\", where he attempts to join the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], but he is rejected.\\n\\nIn 2024, Wilson has retired from being the masked mercenary known as Deadpool and began to work as an used car salesman after breaking up with his girlfriend [[Vanessa Carlysle]]. During his birthday party, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) captures Wilson and delivers him to [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]], who offers him to join Earth-616. However, Paradox also reveals that Wilson\\'s timeline would deteriorate as a result of the death of [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett]],{{Efn|name=Logan|As depicted in \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017)}} who is revealed to be the timeline\\'s \"anchor being\". Wilson steals Paradox\\'s [[TemPad]] to travel the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] and find a variant of Logan to save his timeline.\\n\\nAfter encountering various Logan variants, Wilson takes one back to the TVA, where he learns that this particular Logan destroyed his own universe before Paradox prunes them both into the [[Void (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Void]]. Wilson and Logan fight before they and [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]{{Efn|name=JohnnyStorm|from \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\\'\\' (2005)}} are captured and sent to [[Cassandra Nova]], who Logan identifies as the twin sister of [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]]. Upon arriving at Nova\\'s lair, she kills Johnny and tries to puzzle Wilson with the feeling of not being needed, before [[Alioth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alioth]] appears. Wilson and Logan escape before Alioth can consume them.\\n\\nFollowing their escape, Wilson and Logan are directed by a variant of Wilson to travel to the Void\\'s borderlands to join the resistance against Nova and her forces, but Logan chastises Wilson for hiding the fact that Wilson knew how to return them to their original timelines. Arriving at the borderlands, Wilson and Logan meet the resistance members [[Elektra (character)|Elektra Natchios]],{{Efn|name=Elektra|from \\'\\'[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]\\'\\' (2005)}} [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]],{{Efn|name=Blade|from \\'\\'[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]\\'\\' (1998)}} [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]],{{Efn|name=Gambit|from the aborted \\'\\'Gambit\\'\\' film, planned as a spin-off to \\'\\'[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]\\'\\' (2009)}} and [[X-23]], nicknamed the \"Others\" by Wilson. The Others want to team up with Wilson and Logan to fight Nova, but Logan refuses to cooperate, though he eventually relents after a conversation with X-23 about the tragic past making him the worst Wolverine in the multiverse.\\n\\nWilson, Logan, and the Others go to confront Nova, who has Logan mentally incapacitated, but Wilson places [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]]\\'s helmet on her to block her powers. [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] shoots Nova and reveals himself as Paradox\\'s sleeper agent assigned to keep her inside the Void. Logan persuades Wilson to remove the helmet to allow Nova to heal, and guarantees that Xavier would help her if he knows she still exists. In exchange, Nova uses a sling ring from a [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Doctor Strange]] variant to open a portal for the duo to travel to Wade\\'s timeline.\\n\\nUpon arriving on Earth-10005, Wilson and Logan find that Paradox is using the Time Ripper, a device Paradox developed to destroy Wilson\\'s timeline without permission from his superior. Nova quickly learns this from the executed Pyro as well, as she arrives through another portal and kidnaps Paradox. Wilson and Logan battle the [[Deadpool Corps]], an army of Deadpool variants coming from the portal, before Nova takes control of the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines as revenge for Paradox\\'s betrayal. Paradox tells Wilson and Logan that one can disrupt the power flow of the Time Ripper at the cost of their life. Using their own bodies as a conductor, Wilson and Logan destroy both Nova and the Time Ripper, while [[Hunter B-15]] arrests Paradox.\\n\\nOthers are returned to their respective timelines upon Wilson\\'s request, while Logan is permitted to stay in Wilson\\'s timeline, which no longer deteriorates. Logan hopes for a change of his past, but B-15 tells him that his past is what makes him the anchor needed to save Wilson\\'s timeline, and there is no reason for further change. Logan chooses to retire and live a peaceful life. Before his departure, Wilson takes Logan to meet his friends, and X-23 is invited to the party as well. Encouraged by Logan, Wilson reconciles with Carlysle.\\n\\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Wilson exposes footage of Storm saying the words that led to his murder by Nova.\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n<!-- Order per poster billing block -->\\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson / Deadpool]]:<br />A wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]] to treat terminal cancer.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> The start of the film sees Wilson no longer operating as Deadpool, no longer dating Vanessa, and working as an used car salesman.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Writer [[Rhett Reese]] described Deadpool as a [[wikt:fish out of water|fish-out-of water]] in the film, a lunatic dropped into the \"sane world\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"ReeseJun2022\" /> Reynolds said the audience did not have to take Deadpool seriously, particularly with his [[fourth wall]] breaking and [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]], but he wanted them to be invested in the other characters.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Reynolds also portrays a long-haired, non-scarred variant of Deadpool.<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />\\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]]:<br />A former member of the [[X-Men]] and a mutant with healing abilities, retractable claws, and an [[adamantium]]-infused skeleton.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> This version of the character is from an alternative universe where he let down the inhabitants.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailerCameos\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> This, along with pairing Wolverine with Deadpool, allowed Jackman to explore new aspects of the character than in his prior appearances in [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman said Logan and Wilson were opposites and had a \"quarreling dynamic\",<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> while director [[Shawn Levy]] said their relationship is impacted by both characters being \"haunted with regret\".<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> To prepare for the role, Jackman began a vigorous workout routine that included eating up to 8,000 calories a day.<ref name=\"JackmanWorkout\" /> Jackman also portrays various variants of Wolverine, including: one with the character\\'s comics-accurate height of {{convert|5|ft|3|in|cm}}; Wolverine\\'s gambling alter-ego [[Patch (character)|Patch]], who wears an eyepatch and a white tux; an [[Old Man Logan]] variant; a variant being crucified on a giant X, reminiscent of the cover of \\'\\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\\'\\' (1981) #251; a variant wearing the original brown and tan costume from the comics; and a variant with \"[[glam rock]]-like\" hair and a black costume similar to the [[X-Men: Legacy|1990s \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' comics]].<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />\\n* [[Emma Corrin]] as [[Cassandra Nova]]:<br />A mutant with telekinetic and telepathic powers, who is the twin sister of [[Charles Xavier (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Charles Xavier]] with [[Extraterrestrial life|other-worldly]] origins.<ref name=\"EWMay2024\" /><ref name=\"EWVideoJul2024\" />{{rp|10:43–10:51}} Corrin was excited to play a villain in the film as they had not played many villainous roles before.<ref name=\"CorrinEmpire\" /> Corrin took inspiration from [[Christoph Waltz]]\\'s character [[Hans Landa]] in the film \\'\\'[[Inglourious Basterds]]\\'\\' (2009), while Reynolds highlighted Corrin\\'s humanization and the motivation of the character, comparing Nova\\'s \"mischief, danger, [and] unpredictability\" to the energy of actor [[Gene Wilder]].<ref name=\"CorrinInspiration\" /> Reynolds and Levy explained Nova to Corrin as someone who would endear and charm you to the point that \"you are going to be best friends for life\" only to realize she could easily kill you.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Corrin was interested in having a physical transformation for the role but was told by the studio that this was not required for the character.<ref name=\"CorrinNoPT\" /> Corrin also wanted to pay homage to [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[James McAvoy]]\\'s performances as Xavier in previous \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films, as well as be faithful to Nova\\'s relationship with him from the comics.<ref name=\"CorrinScreenRant\" />\\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]]:<br />A [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) agent who is overseeing a project to speed up the death of the [[Earth-10005]] universe by using the \"Time Ripper\", a machine which can [[mercy kill]] timelines.

The third film was set to include the superhero team [[X-Force]].<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] chose not to return for the sequels due to creative differences with star [[Ryan Reynolds]], and [[David Leitch]] was hired to direct \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018) in November 2016. Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film.<ref name=\"LeitchDP2\" /> In March 2017, \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' and \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' co-writer [[Rhett Reese]] said X-Force would be introduced in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' before starring in a planned spin-off film that would launch \"something bigger\", separate from the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, which would be more personal.<ref name=\"ReeseMar2017\" /> When the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] was announced in December 2017, [[the Walt Disney Company]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] said Reynolds\\'s [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] would be integrated with the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). This was despite those films being rated [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] and the \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films being [[R rating (Motion Picture Association)|R-rated]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxMCU\" /> Iger said Disney was willing to make R-rated \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films \"as long as we let the audiences know what\\'s coming\" and said a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool.<ref name=\"DisneyMarvelR\" /> In May 2018, Reynolds said a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDP3Unsure\" /> Reese and his writing partner [[Paul Wernick]] said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was released, similar to the MCU crossover film \\'\\'[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]\\'\\' (2012) being released between \\'\\'[[Iron Man 2]]\\'\\' (2010) and \\'\\'[[Iron Man 3]]\\'\\' (2013).<ref name=\"May2018IGNReeseWernick\" />\\n\\nAt the end of May 2018, Leitch expressed interest in returning for another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, depending on the schedule.<ref name=\"LeitchDoGMay2018\" /> A third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was believed to be in active development by that August, with production planned to take place in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, rather than in [[Vancouver]], Canada, where the previous films were made.<ref name=\"Aug2018AtlantaProd\" /> \\'\\'[[Once Upon a Deadpool]]\\'\\', a PG-13 version of \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\', was released at the end of the year. It was watched carefully by Disney and [[Marvel Studios]] to see how it might inform their approach to the character in the MCU.<ref name=\"OnceUponADeadpool\" /> While promoting \\'\\'Once Upon a Deadpool\\'\\', Reynolds confirmed that a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was in development and said it would go in a \"completely different direction\".<ref name=\"OUADChina\" /> Reynolds later revealed that they were considering a [[road trip film]] styled after \\'\\'[[Rashomon]]\\'\\' (1950) featuring [[Hugh Jackman]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] character [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]].<ref name=\"ReynoldsRoadTrip\" /> [[Karan Soni]], who portrayed [[Dopinder]] in the first two \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films, reiterated these plans and explained that the film would have focused on Deadpool trying to save Christmas by going on a road trip to the North Pole.<ref name=\"SoniInitialDP3Plans\" /> Jackman had himself envisioned a team-up film with Reynolds inspired by \\'\\'[[48 Hrs.]]\\'\\' (1982) while attending a screening of \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' in 2016, but chose to retire from the role of Wolverine after \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017).<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> In March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several [[Marvel Comics]] characters for Marvel Studios, including [[Deadpool]] and the [[X-Men]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxDealClose\" /><ref name=\"FoxDisneyPressRelease\" /> The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \"on hold\".<ref name=\"FoxMarvelOnHold\" />\\n\\n[[Josh Brolin]], who portrayed [[Cable (character)|Cable]] in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] in the MCU, said in June 2019 that he had discussed his future as Cable with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"BrolinJun2019\" /> In October, [[Zazie Beetz]] said she would be surprised if she did not reprise her \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' role of [[Domino (character)|Domino]] in a future film.<ref name=\"BeetzOct2019\" /> That month, Reese and Wernick said they and Reynolds were taking a \"much-needed rest from Deadpool\" while they waited to hear from Marvel Studios about the franchise\\'s future. They confirmed that another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film would be made, that it would be R-rated like the previous films, and that it would integrate the character with the MCU. Wernick said there was never a set [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film between their exhaustion following \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and the announcement of Fox\\'s acquisition by Disney. Reese said they now had to \"land on the right idea and once we do, I think we\\'ll be off to the races\". The writers felt there would be more characters available in the MCU to act as foils for Deadpool compared to their restricted options among the characters that Fox had control over for the previous films.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickOct2019\" />\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nReynolds revealed in mid-October 2019 that he was meeting with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsMeeting\" /> At that time, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking about how the X-Men and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in general would be added to the franchise. Feige described Reynolds as an \"idea machine\" who pitched many different approaches for the film,<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> including a low budget road trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the [[Sundance Film Festival]],<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to \"[[I Guess That\\'s Why They Call It the Blues]]\" by [[Elton John]].<ref name=\"MusicPitch\" /> Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a \\'\\'Rashomon\\'\\'–style team-up film with Wolverine, which would tell one story from three different perspectives.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> He was told that it would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In December, Reynolds confirmed that the \"whole team\" was actively developing a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film at Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDec2019\" />\\n\\nReynolds and Marvel Studios met with potential writers throughout October 2020, including [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] whose pitch was in line with their intentions for the film. The Molyneux sisters were hired to write the screenplay the next month. Reynolds and Marvel Studios were open to Leitch returning for the film, but he was not expected to due to other commitments throughout 2021 and was not involved in hiring the writers.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> Leitch later confirmed that he met with Marvel for the film, but both parties understood that scheduling and other commitments would prevent him from returning.<ref name=\"LeitchAug2022\" /> In January 2021, Feige reaffirmed that the film would receive an R rating and would be set in the MCU. Reynolds was supervising the scripting process at that time, and Feige said filming would not begin until after 2021 due to Reynolds\\'s busy schedule.<ref name=\"FeigeConfirm\" />\\n\\n[[File:Shawn Levy by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Director Shawn Levy at CinemaCon in April 2024, where he promoted the film]]\\nWhile filming \\'\\'[[The Adam Project]]\\'\\' (2022) with director [[Shawn Levy]], Reynolds approached Levy about working together on the next \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film after they had become frequent collaborators. Reynolds assumed Levy would not be interested due to it being a sequel and not an original work, but Levy was enthused about the idea as long as they had the right story to tell.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> In July 2021, Reynolds and [[Taika Waititi]] promoted their film \\'\\'[[Free Guy]]\\'\\' (2021), also directed by Levy, by appearing as Deadpool and Waititi\\'s MCU character [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]], respectively, in a commercial for that film titled \\'\\'[[Deadpool and Korg React]]\\'\\'. Deadpool, who often breaks the [[fourth wall]], discusses joining the MCU with Korg in the commercial.<ref name=\"VarietyFreeGuyAd\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFreeGuyAd\" /> The next month, Reynolds said he expected filming to begin in 2022,<ref name=\"ReynoldsAug2021\" /> which Feige soon confirmed. Feige added that Marvel Studios had a release timeframe in mind for the film.<ref name=\"FeigeAug2021\" /> In November, Beetz and [[Rob Delaney]] expressed interest in returning as their \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' characters Domino and Peter,<ref name=\"BeetzNov2021\" /><ref name=\"DelaneyNov2021\" /> but Beetz ultimately did not return for the third film.<ref name=\"NoBeetz\" /> Also in November, Reynolds said they were \"plugging away\" at the film.<ref name=\"ReynoldsNov2021\" />\\n\\nLevy was revealed to be directing the film in March 2022,<ref name=\"LevyMar2022THR\" /><ref name=\"LevyMar2022Variety\" /> and said filming would not begin until after 2022 due to his busy schedule through the remainder of the year.<ref name=\"LevyNo2022Filming\" /> Reese and Wernick were hired to rewrite the screenplay,<ref name=\"LevyMar2022THR\" /><ref name=\"LevyMar2022Variety\" /> and said they were excited to use MCU elements in the film. They added that Disney and Marvel were supportive of jokes about the MCU that they were writing for Deadpool given the success of the previous films. They would not confirm whether they were starting from scratch or reworking the previous draft by the Molyneux sisters.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickJun2022\" /> In June, [[Ray Chan (art director)|Raymond Chan]] was revealed to be the production designer after working on the [[Disney+]] MCU miniseries \\'\\'[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]\\'\\' (2021).<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Feige said in July that the film would be elevated from the first two in a similar way to other third installments of MCU film series, such as \\'\\'[[Captain America: Civil War]]\\'\\' (2016), \\'\\'[[Thor: Ragnarok]]\\'\\' (2017), and \\'\\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\\'\\' (2018).<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2022\" />\\n\\nLevy and Reynolds worked on the script with Reese, Wernick, and [[Zeb Wells]],<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> who previously worked on the MCU miniseries \\'\\'[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]\\'\\' (2022) and \\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies (miniseries)|Marvel Zombies]]\\'\\' (2024), and the film \\'\\'[[The Marvels]]\\'\\' (2023).<ref name=\"Disney+DayDeadline\" /><ref name=\"WellsPastMCUWork\" /> They all began to feel that they did not have an original story that was not derivative of the other \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films. Levy explained that they felt the film had to be \"deserving\" of being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film set within the MCU, while still feeling \"grounded because this is an earthbound, gritty, realistic superhero franchise\". Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea,<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea for the film.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In August 2022, Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film. Reynolds was preparing for a meeting with Feige to discuss how to proceed given their lack of story ideas, and realized that including Wolverine would solve many of the issues they were coming up against.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman had a change of heart, after being content with his decision to retire as Wolverine for several years, and decided that a team-up film with Reynolds \"could be so much fun; I\\'ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I\\'ve ever done\".<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> Feige advised Jackman not to return, as he felt Wolverine\\'s death in \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' was the \"greatest ending in history\" and did not want to undo that. He was won over by the idea that Jackman would portray a new version of Wolverine, and Jackman confirmed that he wanted to return after taking a long drive to think about it.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" />\\n\\nReynolds announced in September 2022 that Jackman would return as Wolverine for \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\', which was set for release on September 6, 2024.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> The pair said the film would avoid affecting the events of \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' by using a [[narrative device]] from Marvel Studios that allowed different versions of characters to move around timelines.<ref name=\"JackmanDifferentLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanDec2022\" /> Levy said preserving \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'{{\\'s}} legacy was top priority for the creative team.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman reached out to \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' director [[James Mangold]] to inform him of the film\\'s story and said Mangold was both enthusiastic about the idea and relieved that \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' would not be impacted.<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> Alongside Feige, Reynolds and Levy produced the film through their respective production companies [[Maximum Effort]] and [[21 Laps Entertainment]],<ref name=\"Corrin\" /><ref name=\"MaximumEffort\" /><ref name=\"21Laps\" /> as did \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]].<ref name=\"TrailerViews\" /> [[Simon Kinberg]] served as an executive producer after producing the previous \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films and some \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films.<ref name=\"Kinberg\" /><ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /><ref name=\"DPWolverineMarvel\" /> He said the film had been authored by Levy, Reynolds, and Feige, and they all cared deeply about \\'\\'Logan\\'\\', Deadpool, and Wolverine.<ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /> Levy added that the legacies of Deadpool and Wolverine informed the film\\'s story and themes.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Jackman said the film may not be titled \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\',<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> with Reynolds later referring to it as \"The Deadpool/Wolverine film\",<ref name=\"ReynoldsVarietyNov2022\" /> and Jackman referring to it as \\'\\'Wolverine and Deadpool\\'\\'.<ref name=\"JackmanJan2023\" /> Levy said the creative team were discussing multiple options for the title, and he had at times referred to it as \\'\\'Deadpool Versus Wolverine\\'\\', \\'\\'Deadpool and Wolverine\\'\\', and \\'\\'Deadpool 3 with Wolverine\\'\\'.<ref name=\"NoTitle\" /> The film\\'s official title was announced as \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' in February 2024,<ref name=\"EWSuperBowl\" /> with Levy acknowledging that it was the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film but he did not want to call it \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\' because it is a \"two-hander character adventure\" that focuses on both characters.<ref name=\"LevyTitleApr2024\" /> Despite this, Reynolds said the film was tonally still a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, with violence, swearing, and \"[[wikt:meta|meta]] mayhem\".

Marvel had been considering Corrin since late 2022 but had to work through scheduling issues with their other commitments before they signed on.<ref name=\"Corrin\" /> Corrin was cast after Levy saw their performance in a stage production of [[Virginia Woolf]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]\\'\\'.<ref name=\"CorrinEmpire\" /> In March, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), [[Mobius M.

They said these were conservative projections and it was likely to open higher. \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' noted that no R-rated film had ever opened domestically over $200&nbsp;million, with the record opening for an R-rated film being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' with $132.4&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"QuorumBOTracking\" /> Three weeks ahead of release, multiple tracking services projected the film would open between $160–165&nbsp;million, which would still be a record opening for an R-rated film and the best opening for a 2024 release. \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' said Disney was expecting an opening in this range, and added that presale tickets was at $19&nbsp;million. Quorum reaffirmed its projection of a $200+ million opening at that time.<ref name=\"Deadline3WeeksBOTracking\" />\\n\\nThe week of its release, \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' projected a worldwide opening between $340–360&nbsp;million. A noted increase from prior, lesser predictions which did not consider the substantial walk-up business observed from Latino and Hispanic viewers, it was a factor from which other movies heavily benefited during that summer. The larger prediction included an estimated contribution from that demographic, as well as consideration for the prospects of the film being viewed by a younger audience. At that point, ticket pre-sales for the United States and Canada stood at $35&nbsp;million, a number taken that last Friday, July 19.<ref name=\"DeadlineOpeningBOTracking\" />\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\n{{RT prose|81|7.2|169|Ryan Reynolds makes himself at home in the MCU with acerbic wit while Hugh Jackman provides an Adamantium backbone to proceedings in \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\', an irreverent romp with a surprising soft spot for a bygone era of superhero movies.|ref=y|access-date=July 24, 2024}} {{Metacritic film prose|55|48|ref=y|access-date=July 23, 2024}}\\n\\n\\'\\'[[IGN]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Tom Jorgensen praised Jackman\\'s return to the character. He felt slightly disappointed that Deadpool did not top the lewdness his previous jokes from the first two films and felt the exposition was slow, but he appreciated its function as a buddy comedy.<ref name=\"IGNReview\" /> Writing for \\'\\'[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]\\'\\', Olly Richards gave the film four stars out of five. He praised the film for \"do[ing] all it can to bring everyone along for the ride, including those who don\\'t know their Professor X from their X-23\".<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> Brian Lowry wrote for [[CNN]] that it showcased Marvel Studios\\'s willingness to partake in self-deprecation, and a respect for the superhero films of the 2000s.<ref name=\"CNNReview\" /> In a very positive review, \\'\\'[[Deadline Hollywood]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Pete Hammond felt that the collaboration between the film\\'s titular characters, which resembled \\'\\'[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]\\'\\' (2021) and \\'\\'[[Midnight Run]]\\'\\' (1988), \"works {{em|beyond}} your wildest screen-team dreams\", praised how director Levy leveraged the best from the stars, and noted that Deadpool\\'s raunchy jokes \"come [...] so rapid-fire this time, even more so than in the first two \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' [films].\"<ref name=\"DeadlineReview\" />\\n\\nReviewing for \\'\\'[[Collider (website)|Collider]]\\'\\', Ross Bonaime wrote that with the integration of Deadpool into the larger Marvel property, the character finally started to live up to his full potential. He called him \"far more violent, foul-mouthed, and irreverent towards its surroundings than ever before\", and praised Disney\\'s allowance for the character to be expressed unhindered.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> The \\'\\'[[Chicago Sun-Times]]\\'\\' columnist Richard Roeper, who gave the film three out of four stars, highlighted the star performances, violence, humor, and [[Easter eggs (media)|Easter eggs]], which he described as more abundant than the ones \"on the White House lawn on a Monday in April\", though he threw shade at the \"usual\" plot and \"paper-thin\" story.<ref name=\"ChicagoSTReview\" /> [[Associated Press]] writer Krysta Fauria said that while the genre\\'s critics would not be won over, the film\\'s increased focus on its self-aware genre criticism helped it find a \"sweet spot\" in being an improvement over its predecessors. He felt that Levy was benefited in the increased budget and that the homoerotic yet hate-filled relationship between the titular characters was enticing.<ref name=\"AssociatedPressReview\" />\\n\\nThe \\'\\'[[San Francisco Chronicle]]\\'\\' movie critic Mick LaSalle bemoaned the lack of a plot, which in his opinion would have worked for Deadpool to subvert were there one that the audience could relate to.<ref name=\"SFCReview\" /> \\'\\'[[The Hollywood Reporter]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s David Rooney thought that the meta jokes were \"dialed up to radioactive levels\" and that the critical interpretation remained largely up to what the audience wanted to get out of the film.<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> In one-star reviews for the film, Donald Clarke for \\'\\'[[The Irish Times]]\\'\\' wrote that the film is \"the most relentlessly juvenile entry in a sequence that has rarely been confused with [[Ingmar Bergman]]\\'s \\'\\'Faith\\'\\' trilogy\" and chided that the 1966 \\'\\'[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]\\'\\' television series had better humor;<ref name=\"IrishTimesReview\" /> Robbie Collin, chief film critic for \\'\\'[[The Daily Telegraph]]\\'\\' wrote that \"for all the script\\'s winking guffaws about the series\\' mishap-strewn detour into the multiverse, it can\\'t relinquish its nothing-that-happens-here-actually-matters safety net.\"<ref

It is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 34th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and the sequel to \\'\\'[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]\\'\\' (2016) and \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018). The film is directed by [[Shawn Levy]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Rhett Reese]], [[Paul Wernick]], and [[Zeb Wells]]. Reynolds and [[Hugh Jackman]] star as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] and [[Logan (film character)|Wolverine]], respectively, alongside [[Emma Corrin]], [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Rob Delaney]], [[Leslie Uggams]], [[Aaron Stanford]], and [[Matthew Macfadyen]] in supporting roles. In the film, Deadpool is pulled from his quiet life by the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), and he partners with a reluctant Wolverine on a journey to save his universe.\\n\\nDevelopment on a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film began at [[20th Century Fox]] by November 2016, but was placed on hold after the studio was [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquired by Disney]] in March 2019. Control of the character was transferred to Marvel Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds. It [[Crossover (fiction)|integrates]] Deadpool from Fox\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] with the MCU and retains the [[R-rating (Motion Picture Association)|R rating]] of the previous films, making it the first MCU film to have such a rating. [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] joined in November 2020 as writers. Reese and Wernick returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022, when Levy was hired as director. They, along with Reynolds and Wells, had difficulty figuring out the film\\'s story until Jackman decided to reprise his role as Wolverine from the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films in August 2022, alongside numerous other actors from various other non-MCU productions. Filming began in May 2023 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, with additional filming in [[Norfolk]] and at Bovingdon Film Studios. Production was suspended in July due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]], but resumed in November and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in January 2024. The film\\'s title was revealed a month later.\\n\\n\\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' premiered on July 22, 2024, at the [[David H.

During his birthday party, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) captures Wilson and brings him to [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]], who offers him a place on Earth-616. However, Paradox also reveals that Wilson\\'s timeline is deteriorating as a result of the death of [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett]],{{Efn|name=Logan|As depicted in \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017)}} who is revealed to be the timeline\\'s \"anchor being\", an individual whose existence keeps their respective timeline stabilized and intact. Wilson steals Paradox\\'s [[TemPad]] to travel the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] to find a variant of Logan to save his timeline.\\n\\nAfter encountering various Logan variants, Wilson takes one back to the TVA, where he learns that this particular Logan is considered the worst [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the multiverse. After an argument, Paradox prunes them both into the [[Void (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Void]]. Wilson and Logan fight before they and [[Johnny Storm (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Johnny Storm]]{{Efn|name=JohnnyStorm|From the films \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\\'\\' (2005) and \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\\'\\' (2007)}} are captured and taken to [[Cassandra Nova (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Cassandra Nova]], the twin sister of [[X-Men]] leader [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]]. Nova explains that she was pruned into the Void by the TVA as an infant, but eventually made a deal with them to stay there willingly as long as she could do as she pleased. She then kills Johnny and leaves Wilson and Logan to be devoured by\\xa0a cloud-like entity named [[Alioth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alioth]], although they manage to escape.\\n\\nFollowing their escape, Logan and Wilson meet a variant of Wilson, \"Nicepool\", who gives them a car, with which they drive to Void\\'s borderlands to join the resistance against Nova and her forces. However, Logan chastises Wilson for hiding the fact that he is unable to fix Logan\\'s timeline, leading to a fight where both end up unconscious in the car. [[Laura (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Laura]]{{Efn|name=X-23| From \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'}} drives them to the borderlands, where they meet resistance members [[Elektra Natchios (film character)|Elektra Natchios]],{{Efn|name=Elektra|From the films \\'\\'[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]\\'\\' (2003) and \\'\\'[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]\\'\\' (2005)}} [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]],{{Efn|name=Blade|From the [[Blade (franchise)|\\'\\'Blade\\'\\' films]] produced by [[New Line Cinema]].}} and [[Remy LeBeau (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gambit]].{{Efn|name=Gambit|From the [[Gambit (unproduced film)|unproduced \\'\\'Gambit\\'\\' film]], planned as an installment of the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series.}} The resistance, dubbed the \"Others\" by Wilson, proposes an alliance with him and Logan to fight Nova, but Logan refuses to cooperate. However, he eventually relents after a conversation with Laura about his inability to save the X-Men in his universe. Wilson, Logan, and the Others go to confront Nova, who has Logan mentally incapacitated, but Wilson places [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]]\\'s helmet on her to block her powers. [[John Allerdyce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pyro]] shoots Nova and reveals his alliance with Paradox. Logan persuades Wilson to remove the helmet to allow Nova to heal, and in exchange, Nova uses a sling ring left by a [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] variant to open a portal for the duo to travel to Wilson\\'s timeline.\\n\\nUpon arriving on Earth-10005, Wilson and Logan find that Paradox is using the \"Time Ripper\", a device Paradox developed to [[mercy kill]] timelines, and which he plans to use on Wilson\\'s timeline without permission from his superiors. Nova quickly learns this from Pyro before executing him, arrives through another portal, and kidnaps Paradox. Nova then summons an [[Deadpool Corps (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|army of Deadpool variants]] to battle Wilson and Logan, as she plans to take control of the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines, leaving only the Void, as revenge for Paradox\\'s betrayal. Paradox tells Wilson and Logan that one can disrupt the power flow of the Time Ripper at the cost of their life. Using their bodies as conductors, Wilson and Logan destroy the Time Ripper, killing Nova. Paradox is then arrested by [[Hunter B-15]], who heads the TVA.\\n\\nWilson requests B-15 return the Others to their respective timelines, while the latter reveals that Wilson\\'s timeline is no longer deteriorating. Logan hopes for a change in his past, but B-15 tells him that his past is what makes him the anchor needed to save Wilson\\'s timeline and there is no reason for further change. Logan, who wishes to retire and live a peaceful life, is taken by Wilson to meet his friends. On Logan\\'s encouragement, Wilson reconciles with Vanessa.\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n<!-- Starring cast in order per opening credits -->\\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson / Deadpool]]:<br />A wisecracking mercenary from [[Earth-10005]] with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]] to treat terminal cancer.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> The start of the film sees Wilson no longer operating as Deadpool, no longer dating Vanessa, and working as a used car salesman.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Writer [[Rhett Reese]] described Deadpool as a [[wikt:fish out of water|fish-out-of water]] in the film, a lunatic dropped into the \"sane world\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"ReeseJun2022\" /> Reynolds said the audience did not have to take Deadpool seriously, particularly with his [[fourth wall]] breaking and [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]], but he wanted them to be invested in the other characters.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Reynolds also portrays Nicepool, a long-haired, non-scarred variant of Wilson who lacks his healing factor, for which he is credited as \"Gordon Reynolds\".<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" /><ref name=\"DeadpoolCorps\" />\\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]]:<br />A former member of the [[X-Men]] and a mutant with healing abilities, retractable claws, and an [[adamantium]]-infused skeleton.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> This version of the character is from an alternative universe where he let down the inhabitants.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailerCameos\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> This, along with pairing Wolverine with Deadpool, allowed Jackman to explore new aspects of the character than in his prior appearances in [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman said Logan and Wilson were opposites and had a \"quarreling dynamic\",<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> while director [[Shawn Levy]] said their relationship is impacted by both characters being \"haunted with regret\".<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> To prepare for the role, Jackman began a vigorous workout routine that included eating up to 8,000 calories a day.<ref name=\"JackmanWorkout\" /> Jackman also portrays various variants of Wolverine, including: one with the character\\'s comics-accurate height of {{convert|5|ft|3|in|cm}};

This was despite those films being rated [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] and the \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films being [[R rating (Motion Picture Association)|R-rated]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxMCU\" /> Iger said Disney was willing to make R-rated \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films \"as long as we let the audiences know what\\'s coming\" and said a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool.<ref name=\"DisneyMarvelR\" /> In May 2018, Reynolds said a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDP3Unsure\" /> Reese and his writing partner [[Paul Wernick]] said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was released, similar to the MCU crossover film \\'\\'[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]\\'\\' (2012) being released between \\'\\'[[Iron Man 2]]\\'\\' (2010) and \\'\\'[[Iron Man 3]]\\'\\' (2013).<ref name=\"May2018IGNReeseWernick\" />\\n\\nAt the end of May 2018, Leitch expressed interest in returning for another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, depending on the schedule.<ref name=\"LeitchDoGMay2018\" /> A third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was believed to be in active development by that August, with production planned to take place in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, rather than in [[Vancouver]], Canada, where the previous films were made.<ref name=\"Aug2018AtlantaProd\" /> \\'\\'[[Once Upon a Deadpool]]\\'\\', a PG-13 version of \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\', was released at the end of the year.

Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea,<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea for the film.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In August 2022, Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film.

Wattercutter speculated that the film could expand upon queer themes previously explored in \\'\\'Loki\\'\\' and the MCU \\'\\'Thor\\'\\' films.<ref name=\"WiredSuperBowl\" /> The trailer\\'s inclusion of the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)#Issue five|\\'\\'Secret Wars\\'\\' (2015) #5]] comic book issue was also discussed, given that Marvel Studios had announced the film \\'\\'[[Avengers: Secret Wars]]\\'\\' (2027).<ref name=\"PolygonTeaserEEs\" /><ref name=\"CBRTeaserSWComic\" /><ref name=\"TotalFilmTeaserEEs\" /> Shortly after the trailer\\'s premiere, Jackman posted a tongue-in-cheek jab at Reynolds with a modified logo displaying \"\\'\\'Wolverine & Asshole\\'\\'\".<ref name=\"WolverineAsshole\" /> The trailer had 365 million global views in its first 24 hours, surpassing the record of \\'\\'Spider-Man: No Way Home\\'\\' (355.5 million views) to become the most-viewed trailer in that time period.<ref name=\"TrailerViews\" /> The reported views included the 123 million Super Bowl viewers who saw a 30-second version of the trailer.<ref name=\"TrailerViews2\" />\\n\\nA \"silence your phones\" [[public service announcement]] (PSA) with Deadpool and Wolverine opened Disney\\'s presentation at [[CinemaCon]] in April 2024, during which Feige and Levy debuted nine minutes of footage from the film. \\'\\'[[The Hollywood Reporter]]\\'\\' said this \"drew the biggest laughter\" of all the presentations at the convention.<ref name=\"2024CinemaCon\" /> It included repurposed \\'\\'[[Thor: The Dark World]]\\'\\' (2013) footage of [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], who is mourning the supposed death of Deadpool rather than [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] as seen in that film.<ref name=\"HemsworthArchiveFootage\" /><ref name=\"HemsworthInterview\" /> The PSA was later released publicly.<ref name=\"PSARelease\" /> An official trailer debuted on April 22, set to \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\" by [[Madonna]].<ref name=\"OfficialTrailer\" /> A trailer released on May 20, 2024, announcing ticket pre-sales included a [[QR code]] that led to a video of Reynolds reading a disclaimer for the film.<ref name=\"QRCodeDisclaimer\" /> At the end of the month, a special popcorn bucket for the film\\'s theatrical release was revealed,<ref name=\"PopcornBucketReveal\" /> after Feige had said it would be \"intentionally crude and lewd\". This was inspired by the [[Dune: Part Two#Popcorn bucket meme|viral popcorn bucket]] for \\'\\'[[Dune: Part Two]]\\'\\' (2024).<ref name=\"CrudePopcornBucket\" /> The bucket is shaped like Wolverine\\'s head with a \"comically oversized\" mouth for the popcorn or other snacks. A video reveal, set to the \"[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]\" fanfare which was famously used in \\'\\'[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]\\'\\' (1968), shows Deadpool caressing the bucket as popcorn falls into its mouth and butter drips down its nose.<ref name=\"PopcornBucketReveal\" /> \\n\\nA teaser released in early June revealed that the character [[Lady Deadpool]] would appear in the film, prompting speculation about who played the role,<ref name=\"LadyDeadpool\" /> while Reynolds appeared as Deadpool in a \"typically irreverent video\" at [[CineEurope]] later that month to introduce 12 minutes of footage from the film.<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> The cast went on a global marketing tour for the film starting in early July.

The ad was from Maximum Effort, Loon Productions, and Really Original, and was directed by Oren Brimer. Reynolds also posted on social media to discuss his thoughts on the premiere.<ref name=\"BacheloretteAd\" /> On July 19, Deadpool and Wolverine appeared in a music video for the single \"[[Chk Chk Boom]]\" by the South Korean boy band [[Stray Kids]], whose song \"Slash\" is included on the film\\'s soundtrack.<ref name=\"ChkChkBoom\" /> On July 25, Reynolds, Jackman, Levy, Corrin, and Feige screened the film at [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

They said these were conservative projections and it was likely to open higher. \\'\\'[[Deadline Hollywood]]\\'\\' noted that no R-rated film had ever opened domestically over $200&nbsp;million, with the record opening for an R-rated film being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' with $132.4&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"QuorumBOTracking\" /> Three weeks ahead of release, multiple tracking services projected the film would open between $160–165&nbsp;million, which would still be a record opening for an R-rated film and the best opening for a 2024 release. \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' said Disney was expecting an opening in this range, and added that presale tickets was at $19&nbsp;million.

A noted increase from prior, lesser predictions which did not consider the substantial walk-up business observed from Latino and Hispanic viewers, it was a factor from which other movies heavily benefited during that summer. The larger prediction included an estimated contribution from that demographic, as well as consideration for the prospects of the film being viewed by a younger audience.

It is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 34th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and the sequel to \\'\\'[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]\\'\\' (2016) and \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018). The film is directed by [[Shawn Levy]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Rhett Reese]], [[Paul Wernick]], and [[Zeb Wells]]. Reynolds and [[Hugh Jackman]] star as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] and [[Logan (film character)|Wolverine]], respectively, alongside [[Emma Corrin]], [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Rob Delaney]], [[Leslie Uggams]], [[Aaron Stanford]], and [[Matthew Macfadyen]] in supporting roles. In the film, Deadpool is pulled from his quiet life by the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), and he partners with a reluctant Wolverine on a journey to save his universe.\\n\\nDevelopment on a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film began at [[20th Century Fox]] by November 2016, but was placed on hold after the studio was [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquired by Disney]] in March 2019. Control of the character was transferred to Marvel Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds. It [[Crossover (fiction)|integrates]] Deadpool from Fox\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] with the MCU and retains the [[R-rating (Motion Picture Association)|R rating]] of the previous films, making it the first MCU film to have such a rating. [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] joined in November 2020 as writers. Reese and Wernick returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022, when Levy was hired as director. They, along with Reynolds and Wells, had difficulty figuring out the film\\'s story until Jackman decided to reprise his role as Wolverine from the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films in August 2022, alongside numerous other actors from various other non-MCU productions. Filming began in May 2023 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, with additional filming in [[Norfolk]] and at Bovingdon Film Studios. Production was suspended in July due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]], but resumed in November and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in January 2024. The film\\'s title was revealed a month later.  \\n\\n\\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' premiered on July 22, 2024, at the [[David H. Koch Theater]] in [[New York City]], and was released across the United States on July 26, 2024, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Five|Phase Five]] of the MCU.\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nIn 2018, [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson]] uses [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]\\'s [[Time machine|time-traveling device]] to travel from his timeline, [[Earth-10005]],{{efn|The film gives the name \"Earth-10005\" to the main reality of [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />}} to [[Earth-616 (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Earth-616]], the \"[[Sacred Timeline]]\", where he meets [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]] and requests to join the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], but he is rejected.\\n\\nSix years later, Wilson has retired from being the masked mercenary known as Deadpool and is working as a used car salesman after breaking up with his girlfriend [[Vanessa Carlysle (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vanessa Carlysle]]. During his birthday party, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) captures Wilson and brings him to [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]], who offers him a place on Earth-616. However, Paradox also reveals that Wilson\\'s timeline is deteriorating as a result of the death of [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett]],{{Efn|name=Logan|As depicted in \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017)}} who is revealed to be the timeline\\'s stabilizing \"anchor being\". Wilson steals Paradox\\'s [[TemPad]] to travel the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] to find a variant of Logan to save his timeline.\\n\\nAfter encountering various Logan variants, Wilson takes one back to the TVA, where he learns that this particular Logan is considered the worst [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the multiverse. After an argument, Paradox prunes them both into the [[Void (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Void]]. There, Wilson and Logan fight before they and [[Johnny Storm (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Johnny Storm]]{{Efn|name=JohnnyStorm|From the films \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\\'\\' (2005) and \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\\'\\' (2007)}} are captured and taken to [[Cassandra Nova (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Cassandra Nova]], the twin sister of [[X-Men]] leader [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]]. Nova, who was pruned as an infant but made a deal with the TVA to stay willingly in the Void, kills Johnny, and leaves Wilson and Logan to be consumed by [[Alioth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alioth]], although they manage to escape.\\n\\nFollowing their escape, Logan and Wilson meet a variant of Wilson, \"Nicepool\", who gives them a car, with which they drive to the Void\\'s borderlands, where the resistance against Nova is located. However, Logan chastises Wilson for hiding the fact that he is unable to fix Logan\\'s timeline, leading to a fight that leaves them both unconscious. [[Laura (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Laura]]{{Efn|name=X-23| From \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'}} drives them to the borderlands, where they meet resistance members [[Elektra Natchios (film character)|Elektra Natchios]],{{Efn|name=Elektra|From the films \\'\\'[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]\\'\\' (2003) and \\'\\'[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]\\'\\' (2005)}} [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]],{{Efn|name=Blade|From the [[Blade (franchise)|\\'\\'Blade\\'\\' films]] produced by [[New Line Cinema]].}} and [[Remy LeBeau (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gambit]].{{Efn|name=Gambit|From the [[Gambit (unproduced film)|unproduced \\'\\'Gambit\\'\\' film]], planned as an installment of the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series.}} The resistance, dubbed the \"Others\" by Wilson, proposes an alliance with him and Logan to fight Nova, but Logan refuses to cooperate. However, he eventually relents after a conversation with Laura about his inability to save the X-Men in his universe. Wilson, Logan, and the Others go to confront Nova, and they manage to block her powers by placing [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]]\\'s helmet on her head. However, Nova is betrayed and injured by her henchman [[John Allerdyce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pyro]] on behalf of Paradox, but Logan convinces Wilson to remove the helmet, allowing Nova to heal and open a portal back to Wilson\\'s timeline.\\n\\nUpon arriving on Earth-10005, Wilson and Logan find that Paradox is using the \"Time Ripper\", a device he developed to [[mercy kill]] timelines, and which he plans to use on Wilson\\'s timeline without permission from his superiors. Nova quickly learns this from Pyro before executing him, arrives through another portal, and kidnaps Paradox, planning to take control of the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines, leaving only the Void, as revenge for Paradox\\'s betrayal. Nova then summons an [[Deadpool Corps (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|army of Deadpool variants]] to battle Wilson and Logan, but Wilson\\'s friend [[Peter Wisdom (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Wisdom]] convinces them all to retreat. Paradox tells Wilson and Logan that one can disrupt the power flow of the Time Ripper at the cost of their life. Using their bodies as conductors, Wilson and Logan destroy the Time Ripper, killing Nova. Paradox is then arrested by [[Hunter B-15]], who heads the TVA.\\n\\nWilson requests B-15 return the Others to their respective timelines, while the latter reveals that Wilson\\'s timeline is no longer deteriorating. Logan hopes for a change in his past, but B-15 tells him that his past is what makes him the anchor being needed to save Wilson\\'s timeline and there is no reason for further change. Logan, who wishes to retire and live a peaceful life, is taken by Wilson to meet his friends, along with Laura. On Logan\\'s encouragement, Wilson reconciles with Carlysle.\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n<!-- Starring cast in order per opening credits -->\\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson / Deadpool]]:<br />A wisecracking mercenary from [[Earth-10005]] with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]] to treat terminal cancer.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> The start of the film sees Wilson no longer operating as Deadpool, no longer dating Vanessa, and working as a used car salesman.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Writer [[Rhett Reese]] described Deadpool as a [[wikt:fish out of water|fish-out-of water]] in the film, a lunatic dropped into the \"sane world\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"ReeseJun2022\" /> Reynolds said the audience did not have to take Deadpool seriously, particularly with his [[fourth wall]] breaking and [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]], but he wanted them to be invested in the other characters.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Reynolds also portrays Nicepool, a long-haired, non-scarred variant of Wilson who lacks his healing factor, for which he is credited as \"Gordon Reynolds\".<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" /><ref name=\"DeadpoolCorps\" />\\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]]:<br />A former member of the [[X-Men]] and a mutant with healing abilities, retractable claws, and an [[adamantium]]-infused skeleton.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> This version of the character is from an alternative universe where he let down the inhabitants.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailerCameos\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> This, along with pairing Wolverine with Deadpool, allowed Jackman to explore new aspects of the character than in his prior appearances in [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman said Logan and Wilson were opposites and had a \"quarreling dynamic\",<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> while director [[Shawn Levy]] said their relationship is impacted by both characters being \"haunted with regret\".<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> To prepare for the role, Jackman began a vigorous workout routine that included eating up to 8,000 calories a day.<ref name=\"JackmanWorkout\" /> Jackman also portrays numerous variants of Wolverine, including: one with the character\\'s comics-accurate height of {{convert|5|ft|3|in|cm}};

Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film.<ref name=\"LeitchDP2\" /> In March 2017, \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' and \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' co-writer [[Rhett Reese]] said X-Force would be introduced in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' before starring in a planned spin-off film that would launch \"something bigger\", separate from the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, which would be more personal.<ref name=\"ReeseMar2017\" /> When the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] was announced in December 2017, [[the Walt Disney Company]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] said Reynolds\\'s [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] would be integrated with the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). This was despite those films being rated [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] and the \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films being [[R rating (Motion Picture Association)|R-rated]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxMCU\" /> Iger said Disney was willing to make R-rated \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films \"as long as we let the audiences know what\\'s coming\" and said a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool.<ref name=\"DisneyMarvelR\" /> In May 2018, Reynolds said a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDP3Unsure\" /> Reese and his writing partner [[Paul Wernick]] said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was released, similar to the MCU crossover film \\'\\'[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]\\'\\' (2012) being released between \\'\\'[[Iron Man 2]]\\'\\' (2010) and \\'\\'[[Iron Man 3]]\\'\\' (2013).<ref name=\"May2018IGNReeseWernick\" />\\n\\nAt the end of May 2018, Leitch expressed interest in returning for another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, depending on the schedule.<ref name=\"LeitchDoGMay2018\" /> A third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was believed to be in active development by that August, with production planned to take place in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, rather than in [[Vancouver]], Canada, where the previous films were made.<ref name=\"Aug2018AtlantaProd\" /> \\'\\'[[Once Upon a Deadpool]]\\'\\', a PG-13 version of \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\', was released at the end of the year.

They confirmed that another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film would be made, that it would be R-rated like the previous films, and that it would integrate the character with the MCU. Wernick said there was never a set [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film between their exhaustion following \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and the announcement of Fox\\'s acquisition by Disney.

Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea,<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea for the film.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In August 2022, Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film. Reynolds was preparing for a meeting with Feige to discuss how to proceed given their lack of story ideas, and realized that including Wolverine would solve many of the issues they were coming up against.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman had a change of heart, after being content with his decision to retire as Wolverine for several years, and decided that a team-up film with Reynolds \"could be so much fun; I\\'ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I\\'ve ever done\".<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> Feige advised Jackman not to return, as he felt Wolverine\\'s death in \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' was the \"greatest ending in history\" and did not want to undo that.

A noted increase from prior, lesser predictions which did not consider the substantial walk-up business observed from Latino and Hispanic moviegoers, it was a factor from which other movies heavily benefited during that summer. The larger prediction included an estimated contribution from that demographic, as well as consideration for the prospects of the film being viewed by a younger audience. At that point, ticket pre-sales for the United States and Canada stood at $35&nbsp;million, a number taken that last Friday, July 19.<ref name=\"DeadlineOpeningBOTracking\" /> The film made $38.5 million in Thursday night previews, setting a record for an R-rated film.<ref name=\"THROpening38.5\" /> On opening day, the film made $96 million domestically (including thursday previews), being the biggest opening day for an R-rated film and the 6th biggest in history.<ref name=\"DeadlineOpenNums\" /> The film recovered its reported budget in just two days.<ref name=\"TwoBack\" /> It is projected to make $195–205&nbsp;million at the domestic box office and as high as $420+ million worldwide during its opening weekend.<ref name=\"420Global\" /><ref name=\"DomesticOpener200ish\" />\\n<!-- BEFORE YOU ADD A REFERENCE: DEFINE IT IN THE PROPER STYLE AT THE REFERENCES SECTION AND CALL ITS NAME HERE -->\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\nSome publications reported that the film was divisive,{{efn|Multiple references:<ref name=\"IndyConsensus\" /><ref name=\"NMEConsensus\" /><ref name=\"TheWrapConsensus\" /><ref name=\"PinkConsensus /><ref name=\"NYTConsensus\" />}} while others commented that it opened to largely positive reviews.{{efn|Multiple references:<ref name=\"THRConsensus\" /><ref name=\"APConsensus\" /><ref name=\"SRConsensus\" /><ref name=\"USATodayKnow\" />}} {{RT prose|80|7.1|294|Ryan Reynolds makes himself at home in the MCU with acerbic wit while Hugh Jackman provides an Adamantium backbone to proceedings in \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\', an irreverent romp with a surprising soft spot for a bygone era of superhero movies.|ref=y|access-date=July 27, 2024}} {{Metacritic film prose|56|56|ref=y|access-date=July 26, 2024}} Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=July 27, 2024 |website=[[CinemaScore]]}}</ref> while those surveyed by [[PostTrak]] gave the film a 96% overall positive score (an average of 5 out of 5 stars), with 85% saying they would definitely recommend it.<ref name=\"Deadline26\" />\\n\\n\\'\\'[[IGN]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Tom Jorgensen praised Jackman\\'s return to the character.

It is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 34th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and the sequel to \\'\\'[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]\\'\\' (2016) and \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018). The film is directed by [[Shawn Levy]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Rhett Reese]], [[Paul Wernick]], and [[Zeb Wells]]. Reynolds and [[Hugh Jackman]] star as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] and [[Logan (film character)|Wolverine]], respectively, alongside [[Emma Corrin]], [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Rob Delaney]], [[Leslie Uggams]], [[Aaron Stanford]], and [[Matthew Macfadyen]] in supporting roles. In the film, Deadpool is pulled from his quiet life by the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) and he partners with a reluctant Wolverine on a journey to save his universe.\\n\\nDevelopment on a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film began at [[20th Century Fox]] by November 2016, but was placed on hold after the studio was [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquired by Disney]] in March 2019. Control of the character was transferred to Marvel Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds. It |integrates Deadpool from Fox\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] with the MCU and retains the [[R-rating (Motion Picture Association)|R rating]] of the previous films, making it the first MCU film to have such a rating. [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] joined in November 2020 as writers. Reese and Wernick returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022, when Levy was hired as director. They, along with Reynolds and Wells, had difficulty figuring out the film\\'s story until Jackman decided to reprise his role as Wolverine from the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films in August 2022, alongside numerous actors from various non-MCU productions. Filming began in May 2023 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, with additional filming in [[Norfolk]] and at Bovingdon Film Studios. Production was suspended in July due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]], but resumed in November and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in January 2024. The film\\'s title was revealed a month later.  \\n\\n\\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' premiered on July 22, 2024, at the [[David H. Koch Theater]] in [[New York City]], and was released in the United States on July 26, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Five|Phase Five]] of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed over $438&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the [[2024 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth highest-grossing film of 2024]].\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nIn 2018, [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Wade Wilson]] uses [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]\\'s [[Time machine|time-traveling device]] to travel from his timeline, [[Earth-10005]],{{efn|The film gives the name \"Earth-10005\" to the main reality of [[20th Century Fox]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]].<ref name=\"IGN35Minutes\" />}} to [[Earth-616 (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Earth-616]], the \"[[Sacred Timeline]]\", where he meets [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]] and requests to join the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], but he is rejected.\\n\\nSix years later, Wade has retired from being the masked mercenary known as Deadpool and is working as a used car salesman after breaking up with his girlfriend [[Vanessa Carlysle (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vanessa Carlysle]]. During his birthday party, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) captures Wade and brings him to [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]], who offers him a place on Earth-616. However, Paradox also reveals that Wade\\'s timeline is deteriorating as a result of the death of [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett]],{{Efn|name=Logan|As depicted in \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017)}} who is revealed to be the timeline\\'s stabilizing \"anchor being\". Wade steals Paradox\\'s [[TemPad]] to travel the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] to find a variant of Logan to save his timeline.\\n\\nAfter encountering various Logan variants, Wilson takes one back to the TVA, where he learns that this particular Logan is considered the worst [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the multiverse. After an argument, Paradox prunes them both into the [[Void (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Void]]. There, Wilson and Logan fight before they and [[Johnny Storm (film character)|Johnny Storm]]{{Efn|name=JohnnyStorm|From the films \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\\'\\' (2005) and \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\\'\\' (2007)}} are captured and taken to [[Cassandra Nova (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Cassandra Nova]], the twin sister of [[X-Men]] leader [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]]. Cassandra, who was pruned as an infant but made a deal with the TVA to stay willingly in the Void, kills Johnny, and leaves Wade and Logan to be consumed by [[Alioth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alioth]], although they manage to escape.\\n\\nFollowing their escape, Logan and Wade meet a variant of Wade called \"Nicepool\", who gives them a car, with which they drive to the Void\\'s borderlands, where the resistance against Cassandra is located. However, Logan chastises Wade for hiding the fact that he is unable to fix Logan\\'s timeline, leading to a fight that leaves them both unconscious. [[Laura (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Laura]]{{Efn|name=X-23| From \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'}} drives them to the borderlands, where they meet resistance members [[Elektra Natchios (film character)|Elektra Natchios]],{{Efn|name=Elektra|From the films \\'\\'[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]\\'\\' (2003) and \\'\\'[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]\\'\\' (2005)}} [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]],{{Efn|name=Blade|From the [[Blade (franchise)|\\'\\'Blade\\'\\' films]] (1998–2004) produced by [[New Line Cinema]].}} and [[Remy LeBeau (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gambit]].{{Efn|name=Gambit|From the [[Gambit (unproduced film)|unproduced \\'\\'Gambit\\'\\' film]], planned as an installment of the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series.}} The resistance, dubbed the \"Others\" by Wade, proposes an alliance with him and Logan to fight Cassandra but Logan refuses to cooperate. However, he eventually relents after a conversation with Laura about his inability to save the X-Men in his universe. Wade, Logan, and the Others go to confront Cassandra, and they manage to block her powers by placing [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]]\\'s helmet on her head. However, Cassandra is betrayed and injured by her henchman [[John Allerdyce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pyro]] on behalf of Paradox, but Logan convinces Wade to remove the helmet, allowing Cassandra to heal and open a portal back to Wade\\'s timeline.\\n\\nUpon arriving on Earth-10005, Wade and Logan find that Paradox is using the \"Time Ripper\", a device he developed to [[mercy kill]] timelines, and which he plans to use on Wade\\'s timeline without permission from his superiors. Cassandra quickly learns this from Pyro before executing him, arrives through another portal, and kidnaps Paradox. She plans to take control of the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines, leaving only the Void, as revenge for Paradox\\'s betrayal. Cassandra then summons an [[Deadpool Corps (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|army of Deadpool variants]] to battle Wade and Logan, but Wade\\'s friend [[Peter Wisdom (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Wisdom]] convinces them all to retreat. Paradox tells Wade and Logan that one can disrupt the power flow of the Time Ripper at the cost of their life. Using their bodies as conductors, Wade and Logan destroy the Time Ripper, killing Cassandra. Paradox is then arrested by [[Hunter B-15]], who heads the TVA.\\n\\nB-15 reveals that Wade and Logan\\'s actions have stopped Wade\\'s timeline from deteriorating. Wade requests B-15 free the Others from the Void, before asking if it is possible to rewrite the history of Logan\\'s timeline. B-15 replies that it was his history that made Logan the hero needed to stop Cassandra and there is nothing to fix. Logan, who wishes to retire and live a peaceful life, is taken by Wade to meet his friends, along with Laura. On Logan\\'s encouragement, Wade reconciles with Vanessa.\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n<!-- Starring cast in order per opening credits.

[[20th Century Fox]] began developing two sequels. The third film was set to include the superhero team [[X-Force]].<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] chose not to return for the sequels due to creative differences with star [[Ryan Reynolds]], and [[David Leitch]] was hired to direct \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018) in November 2016. Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film.<ref name=\"LeitchDP2\" /> In March 2017, \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' and \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' co-writer [[Rhett Reese]] said X-Force would be introduced in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' before starring in a planned spin-off film that would launch \"something bigger\", separate from the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, which would be more personal.<ref name=\"ReeseMar2017\" /> When the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] was announced in December 2017, [[the Walt Disney Company]] CEO [[Bob Iger]] said Reynolds\\'s [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] would be integrated with the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). This was despite those films being rated [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] and the \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films being [[R rating (Motion Picture Association)|R-rated]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxMCU\" /> Iger said Disney was willing to make R-rated \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films \"as long as we let the audiences know what\\'s coming\" and said a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool.<ref name=\"DisneyMarvelR\" /> In May 2018, Reynolds said a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDP3Unsure\" /> Reese and his writing partner [[Paul Wernick]] said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was released, similar to the MCU crossover film \\'\\'[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]\\'\\' (2012) being released between \\'\\'[[Iron Man 2]]\\'\\' (2010) and \\'\\'[[Iron Man 3]]\\'\\' (2013).<ref name=\"May2018IGNReeseWernick\" />\\n\\nAt the end of May 2018, Leitch expressed interest in returning for another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, depending on the schedule.<ref name=\"LeitchDoGMay2018\" /> A third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was believed to be in active development by that August, with production planned to take place in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, rather than in [[Vancouver]], Canada, where the previous films were made.<ref name=\"Aug2018AtlantaProd\" /> \\'\\'[[Once Upon a Deadpool]]\\'\\', a PG-13 version of \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\', was released at the end of the year. It was watched carefully by Disney and [[Marvel Studios]] to see how it might inform their approach to the character in the MCU.<ref name=\"OnceUponADeadpool\" /> While promoting \\'\\'Once Upon a Deadpool\\'\\', Reynolds confirmed that a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film was in development and said it would go in a \"completely different direction\".<ref name=\"OUADChina\" /> Reynolds later revealed that they were considering a [[road trip film]] styled after \\'\\'[[Rashomon]]\\'\\' (1950) featuring [[Hugh Jackman]]\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] character [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine]].<ref name=\"ReynoldsRoadTrip\" /> [[Karan Soni]], who portrayed [[Dopinder]] in the first two \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films, reiterated these plans and explained that the film would have focused on Deadpool trying to save Christmas by going on a road trip to the North Pole.<ref name=\"SoniInitialDP3Plans\" /> Jackman had himself envisioned a team-up film with Reynolds inspired by \\'\\'[[48 Hrs.]]\\'\\' (1982) while attending a screening of \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' in 2016, but chose to retire from the role of Wolverine after \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017).<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> In March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several [[Marvel Comics]] characters for Marvel Studios, including [[Deadpool]] and the [[X-Men]].<ref name=\"DisneyFoxDealClose\" /><ref name=\"FoxDisneyPressRelease\" /> The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \"on hold\".<ref name=\"FoxMarvelOnHold\" />\\n\\n[[Josh Brolin]], who portrayed [[Cable (character)|Cable]] in \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] in the MCU, said in June 2019 that he had discussed his future as Cable with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"BrolinJun2019\" /> In October, [[Zazie Beetz]] said she would be surprised if she did not reprise her \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' role of [[Domino (character)|Domino]] in a future film.<ref name=\"BeetzOct2019\" /> That month, Reese and Wernick said they and Reynolds were taking a \"much-needed rest from Deadpool\" while they waited to hear from Marvel Studios about the franchise\\'s future. They confirmed that another \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film would be made, that it would be R-rated like the previous films, and that it would integrate the character with the MCU. Wernick said there was never a set [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film between their exhaustion following \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and the announcement of Fox\\'s acquisition by Disney. Reese said they now had to \"land on the right idea and once we do, I think we\\'ll be off to the races\". The writers felt there would be more characters available in the MCU to act as foils for Deadpool compared to their restricted options among the characters that Fox had control over for the previous films.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickOct2019\" />\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nReynolds revealed in mid-October 2019 that he was meeting with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsMeeting\" /> At that time, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking about how the X-Men and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in general would be added to the franchise. Feige described Reynolds as an \"idea machine\" who pitched many different approaches for the film,<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> including a low budget road trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the [[Sundance Film Festival]],<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to \"[[I Guess That\\'s Why They Call It the Blues]]\" by [[Elton John]].<ref name=\"MusicPitch\" /> Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a \\'\\'Rashomon\\'\\'–style team-up film with Wolverine, which would tell one story from three different perspectives.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> He was told that it would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In December, Reynolds confirmed that the \"whole team\" was actively developing a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film at Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDec2019\" />\\n\\nReynolds and Marvel Studios met with potential writers throughout October 2020, including [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] whose pitch was in line with their intentions for the film. The Molyneux sisters were hired to write the screenplay the next month. Reynolds and Marvel Studios were open to Leitch returning for the film, but he was not expected to due to other commitments throughout 2021 and was not involved in hiring the writers.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> Leitch later confirmed that he met with Marvel for the film, but both parties understood that scheduling and other commitments would prevent him from returning.<ref name=\"LeitchAug2022\" /> In January 2021, Feige reaffirmed that the film would receive an R rating and would be set in the MCU. Reynolds was supervising the scripting process at that time, and Feige said filming would not begin until after 2021 due to Reynolds\\'s busy schedule.<ref name=\"FeigeConfirm\" />\\n\\n[[File:Shawn Levy by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Director Shawn Levy at CinemaCon in April 2024, where he promoted the film]]\\nWhile filming \\'\\'[[The Adam Project]]\\'\\' (2022) with director [[Shawn Levy]], Reynolds approached Levy about working together on the next \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film after they had become frequent collaborators. Reynolds assumed Levy would not be interested due to it being a sequel and not an original work, but Levy was enthused about the idea as long as they had the right story to tell.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> In July 2021, Reynolds and [[Taika Waititi]] promoted their film \\'\\'[[Free Guy]]\\'\\' (2021), also directed by Levy, by appearing as Deadpool and Waititi\\'s MCU character [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]], respectively, in a commercial for that film titled \\'\\'[[Deadpool and Korg React]]\\'\\'. Deadpool, who often breaks the [[fourth wall]], discusses joining the MCU with Korg in the commercial.<ref name=\"VarietyFreeGuyAd\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFreeGuyAd\" /> The next month, Reynolds said he expected filming to begin in 2022,<ref name=\"ReynoldsAug2021\" /> which Feige soon confirmed. Feige added that Marvel Studios had a release timeframe in mind for the film.<ref name=\"FeigeAug2021\" /> In November, Beetz and [[Rob Delaney]] expressed interest in returning as their \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' characters Domino and Peter,<ref name=\"BeetzNov2021\" /><ref name=\"DelaneyNov2021\" /> but Beetz ultimately did not return for the third film.<ref name=\"NoBeetz\" /> Also in November, Reynolds said they were \"plugging away\" at the film.<ref name=\"ReynoldsNov2021\" />\\n\\nLevy was revealed to be directing the film in March 2022,<ref name=\"LevyMar2022THR\" /><ref name=\"LevyMar2022Variety\" /> and said filming would not begin until after 2022 due to his busy schedule through the remainder of the year.<ref name=\"LevyNo2022Filming\" /> Reese and Wernick were hired to rewrite the screenplay,<ref name=\"LevyMar2022THR\" /><ref name=\"LevyMar2022Variety\" /> and said they were excited to use MCU elements in the film. They added that Disney and Marvel were supportive of jokes about the MCU that they were writing for Deadpool given the success of the previous films. They would not confirm whether they were starting from scratch or reworking the previous draft by the Molyneux sisters.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickJun2022\" /> In June, [[Ray Chan (art director)|Raymond Chan]] was revealed to be the production designer after working on the [[Disney+]] MCU series \\'\\'[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]\\'\\' (2021).<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Feige said in July that the film would be elevated from the first two in a similar way to other third installments of MCU film series, such as \\'\\'[[Captain America: Civil War]]\\'\\' (2016), \\'\\'[[Thor: Ragnarok]]\\'\\' (2017), and \\'\\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\\'\\' (2018).<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2022\" />\\n\\nLevy and Reynolds worked on the script with Reese, Wernick, and [[Zeb Wells]],<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> who previously worked on the MCU series \\'\\'[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]\\'\\' (2022) and \\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies (miniseries)|Marvel Zombies]]\\'\\' (2024), and the film \\'\\'[[The Marvels]]\\'\\' (2023).<ref name=\"Disney+DayDeadline\" /><ref name=\"WellsPastMCUWork\" /> They all began to feel that they did not have an original story that was not derivative of the other \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films. Levy explained that they felt the film had to be \"deserving\" of being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film set within the MCU, while still feeling \"grounded because this is an earthbound, gritty, realistic superhero franchise\". Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea,<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea for the film.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In August 2022, Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film. Reynolds was preparing for a meeting with Feige to discuss how to proceed given their lack of story ideas, and realized that including Wolverine would solve many of the issues they were coming up against.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman had a change of heart, after being content with his decision to retire as Wolverine for several years, and decided that a team-up film with Reynolds \"could be so much fun; I\\'ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I\\'ve ever done\".<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> Feige advised Jackman not to return, as he felt Wolverine\\'s death in \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' was the \"greatest ending in history\" and did not want to undo that. He was won over by the idea that Jackman would portray a new version of Wolverine, and Jackman confirmed that he wanted to return after taking a long drive to think about it.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" />\\n\\nReynolds announced in September 2022 that Jackman would return as Wolverine for \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\', which was set for release on September 6, 2024.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> The pair said the film would avoid affecting the events of \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' by using a [[narrative device]] from Marvel Studios that allowed different versions of characters to move around timelines.<ref name=\"JackmanDifferentLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanDec2022\" /> Levy said preserving \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'{{\\'s}} legacy was top priority for the creative team.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman reached out to \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' director [[James Mangold]] to inform him of the film\\'s story and said Mangold was both enthusiastic about the idea and relieved that \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' would not be impacted.<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> Alongside Feige, Reynolds and Levy produced the film through their respective production companies [[Maximum Effort]] and [[21 Laps Entertainment]],<ref name=\"Corrin\" /><ref name=\"MaximumEffort\" /><ref name=\"21Laps\" /> as did \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]].<ref name=\"TrailerViews\" /> [[Simon Kinberg]] served as an executive producer after producing the previous \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films and some \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films.<ref name=\"Kinberg\" /><ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /><ref name=\"DPWolverineMarvel\" /> He said the film had been authored by Levy, Reynolds, and Feige, and they all cared deeply about \\'\\'Logan\\'\\', Deadpool, and Wolverine.<ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /> Levy added that the legacies of Deadpool and Wolverine informed the film\\'s story and themes.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Jackman said the film may not be titled \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\',<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> with Reynolds later referring to it as \"The Deadpool/Wolverine film\",<ref name=\"ReynoldsVarietyNov2022\" /> and Jackman referring to it as \\'\\'Wolverine and Deadpool\\'\\'.<ref name=\"JackmanJan2023\" /> Levy said the creative team were discussing multiple options for the title, and he had at times referred to it as \\'\\'Deadpool Versus Wolverine\\'\\', \\'\\'Deadpool and Wolverine\\'\\', and \\'\\'Deadpool 3 with Wolverine\\'\\'.<ref name=\"NoTitle\" /> The film was originally titled \\'\\'Deadpool & Friend\\'\\', but this was changed the night before the official title was announced as \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' in February 2024 because the former title had been leaked.<ref name=\"TitleLeakChange\" /><ref name=\"EWSuperBowl\" /> Levy acknowledged that it was the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film but he did not want to call it \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\' because it is a \"two-hander character adventure\" that focuses on both characters.<ref name=\"LevyTitleApr2024\" /> Despite this, Reynolds said the film was tonally still a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, with violence, swearing, and \"[[wikt:meta|meta]] mayhem\". He called it \"the most Deadpool movie in the history of Deadpool\".<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Deadpool\" />\\n\\n=== Pre-production ===\\nPre-production work began by October 2022,<ref name=\"BackstageOct2022\" /> less than two months after Jackman decided to join the film.

He said developing the film was one of the most fun creative experiences of his career, citing the film\\'s self-awareness, violence, and foul language.<ref name=\"LevyDec2022\" /> Levy said he did not want to alter the franchise\\'s DNA from the prior films and called the new film \"raw, audacious, [and] very much R-rated\", comparing it to the [[Buddy film|buddy comedy]] films \\'\\'[[Midnight Run]]\\'\\' (1988), \\'\\'48 Hrs.\\'\\', and \\'\\'[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]\\'\\' (1987).<ref name=\"LevyDeadlineSep2023\" />\\n\\n[[Patrick Stewart]], who portrayed [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier / Professor X]] in the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series and reprised the role in the MCU film \\'\\'[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]\\'\\' (2022), had been approached about potentially making an appearance in the film by February 2023.<ref name=\"StewartApproached\" /> Later that month, filming was set to take place in London,<ref name=\"LondonFilming\" /> and [[Emma Corrin]] joined the cast in a lead villain role. Marvel had been considering Corrin since late 2022 but had to work through scheduling issues with their other commitments before they signed on.<ref name=\"Corrin\" /> Corrin was cast after Levy saw their performance in a stage production of [[Virginia Woolf]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]\\'\\'.<ref name=\"CorrinEmpire\" /> In March, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), [[Mobius M.

At that point, ticket pre-sales for the United States and Canada stood at $35&nbsp;million, a number taken that last Friday, July 19.<ref name=\"DeadlineOpeningBOTracking\" /> The film made $38.5&nbsp;million in Thursday night previews, setting a record for an R-rated film.<ref name=\"THROpening38.5\" /> On opening day, the film made $96&nbsp;million domestically (including Thursday previews), being the biggest opening day for an R-rated film and the 6th biggest in history.<ref name=\"DeadlineOpenNums\" /> The film recovered its reported budget in just two days.<ref name=\"TwoBack\" /> It was then projected on that Saturday to make $195–205&nbsp;million at the domestic box office and as high as $420+ million worldwide on its opening weekend.<ref name=\"420Global\" /><ref name=\"DomesticOpener200ish\" /> It would open to $205&nbsp;million domestically and $438&nbsp;million worldwide, achieving the 8th opening weekend and the highest opening weekend for any R-rated film.<ref name=\"TotalOpening\" />\\n<!-- BEFORE YOU ADD A REFERENCE: DEFINE IT IN THE PROPER STYLE AT THE REFERENCES SECTION AND CALL ITS NAME HERE -->\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\nSome publications reported that the film was divisive,{{efn|Multiple references:<ref name=\"IndyConsensus\" /><ref name=\"NMEConsensus\" /><ref name=\"TheWrapConsensus\" /><ref name=\"PinkConsensus /><ref name=\"NYTConsensus\" />}} while others commented that it opened to largely positive reviews.{{efn|Multiple references:<ref name=\"THRConsensus\" /><ref name=\"APConsensus\" /><ref name=\"SRConsensus\" /><ref name=\"USATodayKnow\" />}} {{RT prose|79|7.1|301|Ryan Reynolds makes himself at home in the MCU with acerbic wit while Hugh Jackman provides an Adamantium backbone to proceedings in \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\', an irreverent romp with a surprising soft spot for a bygone era of superhero movies.|ref=y|access-date=July 28, 2024}} {{Metacritic film prose|56|56|ref=y|access-date=July 26, 2024}} Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=July 27, 2024 |website=[[CinemaScore]] |archive-date=January 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102130540/https://www.cinemascore.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> while those surveyed by [[PostTrak]] gave the film a 96% overall positive score (an average of 5 out of 5 stars), with 85% saying they would definitely recommend it.<ref name=\"Deadline26\" />\\n\\n\\'\\'[[IGN]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Tom Jorgensen praised Jackman\\'s return to the character.

He praised the film for \"do[ing] all it can to bring everyone along for the ride, including those who don\\'t know their Professor X from their X-23\".<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> Brian Lowry wrote for [[CNN]] that it showcased Marvel Studios\\' willingness to partake in self-deprecation, and a respect for the superhero films of the 2000s.<ref name=\"CNNReview\" /> In a very positive review, \\'\\'[[Deadline Hollywood]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Pete Hammond felt that the collaboration between the film\\'s titular characters, which resembled \\'\\'[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]\\'\\' (2021) and \\'\\'[[Midnight Run]]\\'\\' (1988), \"works {{em|beyond}} your wildest screen-team dreams\". He praised Levy\\'s leverage of the stars, and noted that Deadpool\\'s raunchy jokes \"come [...] so rapid-fire this time, even more so than in the first two \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' [films].\"<ref name=\"DeadlineReview\" /> \\'\\'[[Forbes]]\\'\\'{{\\'}}s Mark Hughes praised the film as \"pure escapist entertainment, a rollicking fun time and laugh riot from start to finish, with a thin plot and little sense to it all but nobody cares because we love watching these characters together.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\\n\\nReviewing for \\'\\'[[Collider (website)|Collider]]\\'\\', Ross Bonaime wrote that with the integration of Deadpool into the larger Marvel property, the character finally started to live up to his full potential.

He felt that Levy was benefited in the increased budget and that the homoerotic yet hate-filled relationship between the titular characters was enticing.<ref name=\"AssociatedPressReview\" />\\n\\nThe \\'\\'[[San Francisco Chronicle]]\\'\\' movie critic Mick LaSalle opined that the movie could be viewed as having nothing to say, bemoaning that Deadpool could have subverted the plot were there one that he felt the audience could relate to.

It is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 34th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and the sequel to \\'\\'[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]\\'\\' (2016) and \\'\\'[[Deadpool 2]]\\'\\' (2018). The film is directed by [[Shawn Levy]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Rhett Reese]], [[Paul Wernick]], and [[Zeb Wells]]. Reynolds and [[Hugh Jackman]] star as [[Wade Wilson (film character)|Deadpool]] and [[Logan (film character)|Wolverine]], respectively, alongside [[Emma Corrin]], [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Rob Delaney]], [[Leslie Uggams]], [[Aaron Stanford]], and [[Matthew Macfadyen]] in supporting roles. In the film, Deadpool is pulled from his quiet life by the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) and he partners with a reluctant Wolverine on a journey to save his universe.\\n\\nDevelopment on a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film began at [[20th Century Fox]] by November 2016, but was placed on hold after the studio was [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquired by Disney]] in March 2019. Control of the character was transferred to Marvel Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds. It integrates Deadpool from Fox\\'s [[X-Men (film series)|\\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series]] with the MCU and retains the [[R-rating (Motion Picture Association)|R rating]] of the previous films, making it the first MCU film to have such a rating. [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] joined in November 2020 as writers. Reese and Wernick returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022, when Levy was hired as director. They, along with Reynolds and Wells, had difficulty figuring out the film\\'s story until Jackman decided to reprise his role as Wolverine from the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films in August 2022, alongside numerous actors from various non-MCU productions. Filming began in May 2023 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, with additional filming in [[Norfolk]] and at Bovingdon Film Studios. Production was suspended in July due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]], but resumed in November and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in January 2024. The film\\'s title was revealed a month later.  \\n\\n\\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' premiered on July 22, 2024, at the [[David H. Koch Theater]] in [[New York City]], and was released in the United States on July 26, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Five|Phase Five]] of the MCU.

During his birthday party, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA) captures Wade and brings him to [[Paradox (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mr. Paradox]], who offers him a place on Earth-616. However, Paradox also reveals that Wade\\'s timeline is deteriorating as a result of the death it\\'s stabilizing \"anchor being\", [[Logan (film character)|James \"Logan\" Howlett]]{{Efn|name=Logan|As depicted in \\'\\'[[Logan (film)|Logan]]\\'\\' (2017)}}. Paradox details his plans to use the \"Time Ripper\", a device he developed to [[mercy kill]] timelines, to prematurely destroy Wade\\'s timeline. Wade steals Paradox\\'s [[TemPad]] to travel the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] to find a variant of Logan to save his timeline.\\n\\nAfter encountering various Logan variants, Wade takes one back to the TVA, where he learns that this particular Logan is considered the worst [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the multiverse. After an argument, during which Wade learns that Paradox is acting without the knowledge of his superiors, Paradox prunes Wade and Logan into the [[Void (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Void]]. There, Wade and Logan fight before they and [[Johnny Storm (film character)|Johnny Storm]]{{Efn|name=JohnnyStorm|From the films \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\\'\\' (2005) and \\'\\'[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\\'\\' (2007)}} are captured and taken to [[Cassandra Nova (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Cassandra Nova]], the twin sister of [[X-Men]] leader [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]]. Cassandra, who was pruned as an infant but made a deal with the TVA to stay willingly in the Void, kills Johnny and leaves Wade and Logan to be consumed by [[Alioth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alioth]], although they manage to escape.\\n\\nLogan and Wade meet a variant of Wade called \"Nicepool\", who gives them a car and points them to the Void\\'s borderlands, where the resistance against Cassandra is located. However, Logan chastises Wade for hiding the fact that he is unable to fix Logan\\'s timeline, leading to a fight that leaves them both unconscious. [[Laura (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Laura]]{{Efn|name=X-23| From \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'}} drives them to the borderlands, where they meet resistance members [[Elektra Natchios (film character)|Elektra Natchios]],{{Efn|name=Elektra|From the films \\'\\'[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]\\'\\' (2003) and \\'\\'[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]\\'\\' (2005)}} [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Eric Brooks]],{{Efn|name=Blade|From the [[Blade (franchise)|\\'\\'Blade\\'\\' films]] (1998–2004) produced by [[New Line Cinema]].}} and [[Remy LeBeau (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Remy LeBeau]].{{Efn|name=Gambit|From the [[Gambit (unproduced film)|unproduced \\'\\'Gambit\\'\\' film]], planned as an installment of the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series.}} Wade dubs them the \"Others\" and proposes an alliance to fight Cassandra. Logan refuses to cooperate, but eventually relents after a conversation with Laura about his inability to save the X-Men in his universe. Wade, Logan, and the Others go to confront Cassandra, and manage to block her powers by placing [[Juggernaut (character)|Juggernaut]]\\'s helmet on her head. However, Cassandra is betrayed and injured by her henchman [[John Allerdyce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pyro]] on behalf of Paradox. Logan convinces Wade to remove the helmet, allowing Cassandra to heal and open a portal back to Wade\\'s timeline.\\n\\nArriving on Earth-10005, Wade and Logan find that Paradox has begun to use the Time Ripper. Cassandra–learning Paradox\\'s plan from Pyro before executing him–arrives through another portal and kidnaps Paradox. She plans to take control of the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines, leaving only the Void, as revenge for Paradox\\'s betrayal. Cassandra summons an [[Deadpool Corps (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|army of Deadpool variants]] that battle Wade and Logan, but Wade\\'s friend [[Peter Wisdom (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Wisdom]] arrives and convinces them all to retreat. Paradox tells Wade and Logan that one can disrupt the power flow of the Time Ripper. Using their bodies as conductors, Wade and Logan destroy the Time Ripper, killing Cassandra. Paradox is then arrested by [[Hunter B-15]], who heads the TVA{{Efn|name=Loki|Following the defeat of [[He Who Remains]] as depicted in \\'\\'[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]\\'\\'.}}.\\n\\nB-15 reveals that Wade and Logan\\'s actions have stopped Wade\\'s timeline from deteriorating. Wade requests B-15 free the Others from the Void, before asking if it is possible to rewrite the history of Logan\\'s timeline. B-15 replies that it was his history that made Logan the hero needed to stop Cassandra and there is nothing to fix. Logan, who wishes to retire and live a peaceful life, is taken by Wade to meet his friends, along with Laura.

Wernick said there was never a set [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for a third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film between their exhaustion following \\'\\'Deadpool 2\\'\\' and the announcement of Fox\\'s acquisition by Disney. Reese said they now had to \"land on the right idea and once we do, I think we\\'ll be off to the races\". The writers felt there would be more characters available in the MCU to act as foils for Deadpool compared to their restricted options among the characters that Fox had control over for the previous films.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickOct2019\" />\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nReynolds revealed in mid-October 2019 that he was meeting with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsMeeting\" /> At that time, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking about how the X-Men and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in general would be added to the franchise. Feige described Reynolds as an \"idea machine\" who pitched many different approaches for the film,<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> including a low budget road trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the [[Sundance Film Festival]],<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to \"[[I Guess That\\'s Why They Call It the Blues]]\" by [[Elton John]].<ref name=\"MusicPitch\" /> Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a \\'\\'Rashomon\\'\\'–style team-up film with Wolverine, which would tell one story from three different perspectives.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /><ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> He was told that it would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In December, Reynolds confirmed that the \"whole team\" was actively developing a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film at Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ReynoldsDec2019\" />\\n\\nReynolds and Marvel Studios met with potential writers throughout October 2020, including [[Molyneux sisters|Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin]] whose pitch was in line with their intentions for the film. The Molyneux sisters were hired to write the screenplay the next month. Reynolds and Marvel Studios were open to Leitch returning for the film, but he was not expected to due to other commitments throughout 2021 and was not involved in hiring the writers.<ref name=\"MolyneuxSisters\" /> Leitch later confirmed that he met with Marvel for the film, but both parties understood that scheduling and other commitments would prevent him from returning.<ref name=\"LeitchAug2022\" /> In January 2021, Feige reaffirmed that the film would receive an R rating and would be set in the MCU. Reynolds was supervising the scripting process at that time, and Feige said filming would not begin until after 2021 due to Reynolds\\'s busy schedule.<ref name=\"FeigeConfirm\" />\\n\\n[[File:Shawn Levy by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Director Shawn Levy at CinemaCon in April 2024, where he promoted the film]]\\nWhile filming \\'\\'[[The Adam Project]]\\'\\' (2022) with director [[Shawn Levy]], Reynolds approached Levy about working together on the next \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film after they had become frequent collaborators. Reynolds assumed Levy would not be interested due to it being a sequel and not an original work, but Levy was enthused about the idea as long as they had the right story to tell.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> In July 2021, Reynolds and [[Taika Waititi]] promoted their film \\'\\'[[Free Guy]]\\'\\' (2021), also directed by Levy, by appearing as Deadpool and Waititi\\'s MCU character [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]], respectively, in a commercial for that film titled \\'\\'[[Deadpool and Korg React]]\\'\\'.

They would not confirm whether they were starting from scratch or reworking the previous draft by the Molyneux sisters.<ref name=\"ReeseWernickJun2022\" /> In June, [[Ray Chan (art director)|Raymond Chan]] was revealed to be the production designer after working on the [[Disney+]] MCU series \\'\\'[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]\\'\\' (2021).<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Feige said in July that the film would be elevated from the first two in a similar way to other third installments of MCU film series, such as \\'\\'[[Captain America: Civil War]]\\'\\' (2016), \\'\\'[[Thor: Ragnarok]]\\'\\' (2017), and \\'\\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\\'\\' (2018).<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2022\" />\\n\\nLevy and Reynolds worked on the script with Reese, Wernick, and [[Zeb Wells]],<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> who previously worked on the MCU series \\'\\'[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]\\'\\' (2022) and \\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies (miniseries)|Marvel Zombies]]\\'\\' (2024), and the film \\'\\'[[The Marvels]]\\'\\' (2023).<ref name=\"Disney+DayDeadline\" /><ref name=\"WellsPastMCUWork\" /> They all began to feel that they did not have an original story that was not derivative of the other \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films. Levy explained that they felt the film had to be \"deserving\" of being the first \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film set within the MCU, while still feeling \"grounded because this is an earthbound, gritty, realistic superhero franchise\". Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea,<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea for the film.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Pitch\" /> In August 2022, Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film. Reynolds was preparing for a meeting with Feige to discuss how to proceed given their lack of story ideas, and realized that including Wolverine would solve many of the issues they were coming up against.<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman had a change of heart, after being content with his decision to retire as Wolverine for several years, and decided that a team-up film with Reynolds \"could be so much fun; I\\'ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I\\'ve ever done\".<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> Feige advised Jackman not to return, as he felt Wolverine\\'s death in \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' was the \"greatest ending in history\" and did not want to undo that. He was won over by the idea that Jackman would portray a new version of Wolverine, and Jackman confirmed that he wanted to return after taking a long drive to think about it.<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Wolverine\" />\\n\\nReynolds announced in September 2022 that Jackman would return as Wolverine for \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\', which was set for release on September 6, 2024.<ref name=\"ReynoldsJackmanRelease\" /> The pair said the film would avoid affecting the events of \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' by using a [[narrative device]] from Marvel Studios that allowed different versions of characters to move around timelines.<ref name=\"JackmanDifferentLogan\" /><ref name=\"JackmanDec2022\" /> Levy said preserving \\'\\'Logan\\'\\'{{\\'s}} legacy was top priority for the creative team.<ref name=\"VanityFairJun2024\" /> Jackman reached out to \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' director [[James Mangold]] to inform him of the film\\'s story and said Mangold was both enthusiastic about the idea and relieved that \\'\\'Logan\\'\\' would not be impacted.<ref name=\"JackmanBeforeLogan\" /> Alongside Feige, Reynolds and Levy produced the film through their respective production companies [[Maximum Effort]] and [[21 Laps Entertainment]],<ref name=\"Corrin\" /><ref name=\"MaximumEffort\" /><ref name=\"21Laps\" /> as did \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]].<ref name=\"TrailerViews\" /> [[Simon Kinberg]] served as an executive producer after producing the previous \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' films and some \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' films.<ref name=\"Kinberg\" /><ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /><ref name=\"DPWolverineMarvel\" /> He said the film had been authored by Levy, Reynolds, and Feige, and they all cared deeply about \\'\\'Logan\\'\\', Deadpool, and Wolverine.<ref name=\"KinbergSep2023\" /> Levy added that the legacies of Deadpool and Wolverine informed the film\\'s story and themes.<ref name=\"EWCoverJun2024\" /> Jackman said the film may not be titled \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\',<ref name=\"JackmanOct2022\" /> with Reynolds later referring to it as \"The Deadpool/Wolverine film\",<ref name=\"ReynoldsVarietyNov2022\" /> and Jackman referring to it as \\'\\'Wolverine and Deadpool\\'\\'.<ref name=\"JackmanJan2023\" /> Levy said the creative team were discussing multiple options for the title, and he had at times referred to it as \\'\\'Deadpool Versus Wolverine\\'\\', \\'\\'Deadpool and Wolverine\\'\\', and \\'\\'Deadpool 3 with Wolverine\\'\\'.<ref name=\"NoTitle\" /> The film was originally titled \\'\\'Deadpool & Friend\\'\\', but this was changed the night before the official title was announced as \\'\\'Deadpool & Wolverine\\'\\' in February 2024 because the former title had been leaked.<ref name=\"TitleLeakChange\" /><ref name=\"EWSuperBowl\" /> Levy acknowledged that it was the third \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film but he did not want to call it \\'\\'Deadpool 3\\'\\' because it is a \"two-hander character adventure\" that focuses on both characters.<ref name=\"LevyTitleApr2024\" /> Despite this, Reynolds said the film was tonally still a \\'\\'Deadpool\\'\\' film, with violence, swearing, and \"[[wikt:meta|meta]] mayhem\". He called it \"the most Deadpool movie in the history of Deadpool\".<ref name=\"EmpireMay2024Deadpool\" />\\n\\n=== Pre-production ===\\nPre-production work began by October 2022,<ref name=\"BackstageOct2022\" /> less than two months after Jackman decided to join the film.

He said developing the film was one of the most fun creative experiences of his career, citing the film\\'s self-awareness, violence, and foul language.<ref name=\"LevyDec2022\" /> Levy said he did not want to alter the franchise\\'s DNA from the prior films and called the new film \"raw, audacious, [and] very much R-rated\", comparing it to the [[Buddy film|buddy comedy]] films \\'\\'[[Midnight Run]]\\'\\' (1988), \\'\\'48 Hrs.\\'\\', and \\'\\'[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]\\'\\' (1987).<ref name=\"LevyDeadlineSep2023\" />\\n\\n[[Patrick Stewart]], who portrayed [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier / Professor X]] in the \\'\\'X-Men\\'\\' film series and reprised the role in the MCU film \\'\\'[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]\\'\\' (2022), had been approached about potentially making an appearance in the film by February 2023.<ref name=\"StewartApproached\" /> Later that month, filming was set to take place in London,<ref name=\"LondonFilming\" /> and [[Emma Corrin]] joined the cast in a lead villain role. Marvel had been considering Corrin since late 2022 but had to work through scheduling issues with their other commitments before they signed on.<ref name=\"Corrin\" /> Corrin was cast after Levy saw their performance in a stage production of [[Virginia Woolf]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]\\'\\'.<ref name=\"CorrinEmpire\" /> In March, the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA), [[Mobius M.
